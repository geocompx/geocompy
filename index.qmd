# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the online home of *Geocomputation with Python*, a book on reproducible geographic data analysis with open source software.

Inspired by the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial ([FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/)) movement this is an *open source book*.
Find the code underlying the *geocompy* project on [GitHub](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy), ensuring that the content is reproducible, transparent, and accessible.
Making the book open source allows you or anyone else, to interact with the project by opening [issues](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy/issues), making typo fixes and more, for the benefit of everyone.

The book's website is built by GitHub Actions, which runs the code every time we make a change, ensuring code correctness and reproducibility.
The current build status as follows:

You can run the code in the book using GitHub CodeSpaces as follows (requires a GitHub account):
