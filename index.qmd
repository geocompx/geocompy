# Introduction

This site contains ideas, code and an outline of a yet-to-be written book on *Geocomputation with Python*.

## Motivations

*Geocomputation with Python*, is motivated by the need for an introductory yet rigorous and maintained resource on working with geographic data in Python.
A unique feature of the book is that it that demonstrates code for working with *both vector and raster* geographic data types.
<!-- , and how to use them together. -->
There are many resources on Python packages for geographic research and various applications but, to the best of our knowledge, no other resource brings together the following features into a single home:

1. Small introductory textbook focuses on doing basic operations well
2. Integration of vector and raster datasets in the same book, and within each section
3. Clear explanation of the code and exercises to maximize learning for newcomers
4. Provision of lucid example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate the applied nature of geographic research

The book aims to supplement other resources in the ecosystem, as highlighted by comparison with the book's scope with existing and in-progress works:

- [Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-geospatial-analysis-with-python/9781783281138) and [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) focuses on processing spatial data using low-level Python interfaces for GDAL, such as the `gdal`, `gdalnumeric`, and `ogr` [packages](https://gdal.org/api/python.html) from `osgeo`. 
This approach is more complex, [less "Pythonic"](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#philosophy), and perhaps outdated in light of development of packages such as `geopandas` and `rasterio` covered here
- [pythongis.org](https://pythongis.org/) (at an early stage of development) seeks to provide a general introduction to 'GIS in Python', with parts focusing on Python essentials, using Python with GIS, and case studies. 
Compared with pythongis.org, geocompy has a relatively narrow scope (1) and a greater focus on raster-vector interoperability
- [geographicdata.science](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html) is an ambitious project with chapters dedicated to advanced topics, with Chapter 4 on [Spatial Weights](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) getting into complex topics relatively early, for example.
Geocompy would be shorter, simpler and more introductory, and cover raster and vector data with equal importance (1 to 4)

Geocompy is a sister project of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) -- a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language.

## Reproducing this book

An important aspect of scientific research and 'citizen science' that is participatory is reproducibility of results.

### Binder

To reproduce this book you can simply click on the link below to see the code running in your web browser (see details of how this works at [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)):

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geocompr/py/main?urlpath=lab/tree/ipynb)

### Local with Quarto

To run the code locally, recommended for using the material on real data, you need to have a reasonable computer, e.g. with 8 GB RAM.
You'll need administrative rights to install the requirements, which include:

- A suitable integrated development environment (IDE) such as VS Code, RStudio or Jupyter Notebook
- Quarto, if you want to reproduce the book's open access website
- Either an Anaconda-like environment (we recommend `miniconda3`) or Docker to get systems dependencies

See the project's README for details on getting set-up.
After you have installed the necessary dependencies and cloned or [unzipped](https://github.com/geocompr/py/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the book's source code, you should be able to reproduce the code in its entirety with the following command:

```bash
quarto preview
```

If you see output like that below (with the IDE and browser arranged to see live updates after editing the source code), congratulations, it has worked!

### Local with Jupyter

Alternatively, you can [download](https://github.com/geocompr/py/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the book's source code. The unzipped directory `py-main/code/chapters/` contains:

* The source `ipynb` files, one for each Chapter
* The `data` sub-directory with the sample data used in the code sections

Assuming that all required packages are installed (see beginning of each chapter), you can execute the `ipynb` files through your chosen working environment (VScode, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).
