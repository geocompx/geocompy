        "So far the book has explained the structure of geographic datasets (@sec-spatial-class), and how to manipulate them based on their non-geographic attributes (@sec-attr) and spatial relations (@sec-spatial-operations).\n",
        "This chapter focuses on manipulating the geographic elements of geographic objects, for example by simplifying and converting vector geometries, and by cropping raster datasets.\n",
        "After reading it you should understand and have control over the geometry column in vector layers and the extent and geographic location of pixels represented in rasters in relation to other geographic objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-vec covers transforming vector geometries with 'unary' and 'binary' operations.\n",
        "Unary operations work on a single geometry in isolation, including simplification (of lines and polygons), the creation of buffers and centroids, and shifting/scaling/rotating single geometries using 'affine transformations' (@sec-simplification to @sec-affine-transformations).\n",
        "Binary transformations modify one geometry based on the shape of another, including clipping and geometry unions, covered in @sec-clipping and @sec-geometry-unions, respectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-ras covers geometric transformations on raster objects.\n",
        "This involves changing the size and number of the underlying pixels, and assigning them new values.\n",
        "It teaches how to change the extent and the origin of a raster \"manually\" (@sec-extent-and-origin), how to change the resolution in fixed \"steps\" through aggregation and disaggregation (@sec-raster-agg-disagg), and finally how to resample a raster into any existing template, which is the most general and often most practical approach (@sec-raster-resampling).\n",
        "These operations are especially useful if one would like to align raster datasets from diverse sources.\n",
        "Aligned raster objects share a one-to-one correspondence between pixels, allowing them to be processed using map algebra operations (@sec-raster-local-operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next chapter (@sec-raster-vector), we deal with the special case of geometry operations that involve both a raster and a vector layer together.\n",
        "It shows how raster values can be 'masked' and 'extracted' by vector geometries.\n",
