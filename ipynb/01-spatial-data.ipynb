        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter outlines two fundamental geographic data models --- vector and raster --- and introduces the main Python packages for working with them.\n",
        "Before demonstrating their implementation in Python, we will introduce the theory behind each data model and the disciplines in which they predominate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vector data model (@sec-vector-data) represents the world using points, lines, and polygons.\n",
        "These have discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector datasets usually have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy).\n",
        "The raster data model (@sec-raster-data), on the other hand, divides the surface up into cells of constant size.\n",
        "Raster datasets are the basis of background images used in web-mapping and have been a vital source of geographic data since the origins of aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices.\n",
        "Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable, with many worldwide raster datasets available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which to use?\n",
        "The answer likely depends on your domain of application, and the datasets you have access to:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Vector datasets and methods dominate the social sciences because human settlements and and processes (e.g., transport infrastructure) tend to have discrete borders<!--jn: is that true?--> <!-- md: I think that's true but now sure how we can back up this idea, will be happy to hear what everyone thinks -->\n",
        "-   Raster datasets and methods dominate many environmental sciences because of the reliance on remote sensing data\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has strong support for both data models.\n",
        "We will focus on **shapely** and **geopandas** for working with geograpic vector data, and **rasterio** for working with rasters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**shapely** is a \"low-level\" package for working with individual vector geometry objects.\n",
        "**geopandas** is a \"high-level\" package for working with geometry columns (`GeoSeries` objects), which internally contain **shapely** geometries, and vector layers (`GeoDataFrame` objects).\n",
        "The **geopandas** ecosystem provides a comprehensive approach for working with vector layers in Python, with many packages building on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several partially overlapping packages for working with raster data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "In this book, we focus on the most prominent one: **rasterio**, which represents \"simple\" raster datasets with a combination of a **numpy** array, and a metadata object (`dict`) providing geographic metadata such as the coordinate system.\n",
        "**xarray** is a notable alternative to **rasterio** not covered in this book which uses native `xarray.Dataset` and `xarray.DataArray` classes to effectively represent complex raster datasets such as 'NetCDF' files with multiple bands and metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is much overlap in some fields and raster and vector datasets can be used together: ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster data.\n",
        "Furthermore, it is possible to convert between the two forms (see @sec-raster-vector).\n",
        "Whether your work involves more use of vector or raster datasets, it is worth understanding the underlying data models before using them, as discussed in subsequent chapters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Vector data {#sec-vector-data}\n",
        "\n",
        "The geographic vector data model is based on points located within a coordinate reference system (CRS).\n",
        "Points can represent self-standing features (e.g., the location of a bus stop), or they can be linked together to form more complex geometries such as lines and polygons.\n",
        "Most point geometries contain only two dimensions (3-dimensional CRSs may contain an additional $z$ value, typically representing height above sea level).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this system, London, for example, can be represented by the coordinates `(-0.1,51.5)`.\n",
        "This means that its location is -0.1 degrees east and 51.5 degrees north of the origin.\n",
        "The origin, in this case, is at 0 degrees longitude (a prime meridian located at Greenwich) and 0 degrees latitude (the Equator) in a geographic ('lon/lat') CRS (@fig-vector-london, left panel).\n",
        "The same point could also be approximated in a projected CRS with 'Easting/Northing' values of `(530000, 180000)` in the British National Grid, meaning that London is located 530 $km$ East and 180 $km$ North of the origin of the CRS (@fig-vector-london, right panel).\n",
        "The location of National Grid's origin, in the sea beyond South West Peninsular, ensures that most locations in the UK have positive Easting and Northing values.\n",

        "\n",
        "**geopandas** provides classes for geographic vector data and a consistent command-line interface for reproducible geographic data analysis in Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "Tight integration with these geographic libraries makes reproducible geocomputation possible: an advantage of using a higher level language such as Python to access these libraries is that you do not need to know the intricacies of the low level components, enabling focus on the methods rather than the implementation.\n",

        "### Vector data classes\n",
        "\n",
        "The main classes for working with geographic vector data in Python are hierarchical, meaning the highest level 'vector layer' class is composed of simpler 'geometry column' and individual 'geometry' components.\n",
        "This section introduces them in order, starting with the highest level class.\n",
        "For many applications, the high level vector layer class, which are essentially a data frame with geometry columns, are all that's needed.\n",
        "However, it's important to understand the structure of vector geographic objects and their component pieces for more advanced applications.\n",
        "The three main vector geographic data classes in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `GeoDataFrame`, a class representing vector layers, with a geometry column (class `GeoSeries`) as one of the columns\n",
        "-   `GeoSeries`, a class that is used to represent the geometry column in `GeoDataFrame` objects\n",
        "-   `shapely` geometry objects which represent individual geometries, such as a point or a polygon\n",
        "\n",
        "The first two classes (`GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries`) are defined in **geopandas**.\n",
        "The third class is defined in the **shapely** package, which deals with individual geometries, and is a main dependency of the **geopandas** package.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector layers {#sec-vector-layers}\n",
        "\n",
        "The most commonly used geographic vector data structure is the vector layer.\n",
        "There are several approaches for working with vector layers in Python, ranging from low-level packages (e.g., **osgeo**, **fiona**) to the relatively high-level **geopandas** package that is the focus of this section.\n",
        "Before writing and running code for creating and working with geographic vector objects, we need to import **geopandas** (by convention as `gpd` for more concise code) and **shapely**."
