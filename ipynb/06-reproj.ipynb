        "@sec-coordinate-reference-systems-intro introduced coordinate reference systems (CRSs), with a focus on the two major types: geographic ('lon/lat', with units in degrees longitude and latitude) and projected (typically with units of meters from a datum) coordinate systems.\n",
        "This chapter builds on that knowledge and goes further.\n",
        "It demonstrates how to set and transform geographic data from one CRS to another and, furthermore, highlights specific issues that can arise due to ignoring CRSs that you should be aware of, especially if your data is stored with lon/lat coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- In many projects there is no need to worry about, let alone convert between, different CRSs. -->\n",
        "<!-- jn: these two sentences do not \"glue\" well -->\n",
        "<!-- md: I suggest keeping just the 2nd sentence -->\n",
        "It is important to know if your data is in a projected or geographic coordinate system, and the consequences of this for geometry operations.\n",
        "However, if you know the CRS of your data and the consequences for geometry operations (covered in the next section), CRSs should just work behind the scenes: people often suddenly need to learn about CRSs when things go wrong.\n",
        "Having a clearly defined project CRS that all project data is in, plus understanding how and why to use different CRSs, can ensure that things do not go wrong.\n",
        "Furthermore, learning about coordinate systems will deepen your knowledge of geographic datasets and how to use them effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter teaches the fundamentals of CRSs, demonstrates the consequences of using different CRSs (including what can go wrong), and how to \"reproject\" datasets from one coordinate system to another.\n",
        "In the next section we introduce CRSs in Python, followed by @sec-querying-and-setting-coordinate-systems which shows how to get and set CRSs associated with spatial objects.\n",
        "@sec-geometry-operations-on-projected-and-unprojected-data demonstrates the importance of knowing what CRS your data is in with reference to a worked example of creating buffers.\n",
        "We tackle questions of when to reproject and which CRS to use in @sec-when-to-reproject and @sec-which-crs-to-use, respectively.\n",
        "Finally, we cover reprojecting vector and raster objects in @sec-reprojecting-vector-geometries and @sec-reprojecting-raster-geometries and modifying map projections in @sec-custom-map-projections.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Coordinate Reference Systems {#sec-coordinate-reference-systems}\n",
        "\n",
        "Most modern geographic tools that require CRS conversions, including Python packages and desktop GIS software such as QGIS, interface with [PROJ](https://proj.org/), an open source C++ library that \"transforms coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another\".\n",
        "CRSs can be described in many ways, including the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Simple, yet potentially ambiguous, statements, such as, \"it's in lon/lat coordinates\"\n",
        "-   Formalized, yet now outdated, 'proj-strings' such as `+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs`\n",
        "-   With an identifying 'authority:code' text string such as `EPSG:4326`\n",
        "\n",
        "Each refers to the same thing: the 'WGS84' coordinate system that forms the basis of Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and many other datasets.\n",
        "But which one is correct?\n",
        "\n",
        "The short answer is that the third way to identify CRSs is correct: `EPSG:4326` is understood by **geopandas** and **rasterio** packages covered in this book, plus many other software projects for working with geographic data including [QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_projections/working_with_projections.html) and [PROJ](https://proj.org/development/quickstart.html).\n",
        "`EPSG:4326` is future-proof.\n",
        "Furthermore, although it is machine readable, unlike the proj-string representation `EPSG:4326` is short, easy to remember and highly 'findable' online (searching for `EPSG:4326` yields a dedicated page on the website [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/4326), for example).\n",
        "The more concise identifier `4326` is also understood by **geopandas** and **rasterio**, but we recommend the more explicit `AUTHORITY:CODE` representation to prevent ambiguity and to provide context.\n",
        "<!-- jn: if we recommend the more explicit representation, why do we use the shorter one in the book? I prefer the longer one, but it is open for the discussion. We need to be consistent. -->\n",
        "<!-- md: I'm not sure I see why we recommend 'AUTHORITY:CODE'. Perhaps we can simply say that it is more clear, but since EPSG is the \"default\" and most common authority the shorter version also works and therefore we use it in the book? -->\n",
        "\n",
        "The longer answer is that none of the three descriptions are sufficient, and more detail is needed for unambiguous CRS handling and transformations: due to the complexity of CRSs, it is not possible to capture all relevant information about them in such short text strings.\n",
        "For this reason, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, which also developed the Simple Features specification that the **geopandas** package implements) developed an open standard format for describing CRSs that is called WKT (Well Known Text).\n",
        "<!-- jn: simple features or Simple Features? We need to be consistent -- please also take a look at previous chapters... -->\n",
