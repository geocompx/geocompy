        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter introduces key Python packages and data structures for working with the two major types of spatial data, namely:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **shapely** and **geopandas** --- for working with vector layers\n",
        "* **rasterio** and **xarray** --- for working with rasters\n",
        "\n",
        "As we will see in the code chunks presented later in this chapter, **shapely** and **geopandas** are related:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **shapely** is a \"low-level\" package for working with individual vector geometry objects\n",
        "* **geopandas** is a \"high-level\" package for working with geometry columns (`GeoSeries` objects), which internally contain **shapely** geometries, and vector layers (`GeoDataFrame` objects)\n",
        "\n",
        "While **geopandas** (including its **shapely** dependency), at present, comprises a ubiquitous comprehensive approach for working with vector layers in Python, this is not the case for rasters.\n",
        "Work with rasters in Python is much less unified. \n",
        "There are several alternative packages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. \n",
        "We focus on the two most comprehensive and fundamental packages, namely:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **rasterio** --- a spatial-oriented package, focused on \"simple\" raster formats (such as GeoTIFF), representing a raster using a combination of a `numpy` array, and a metadata object (`dict`) specifying the spatial referencing of the array\n",
        "* **xarray** --- A general-purpose package for working with labeled arrays, thus advantageous for processing \"complex\" raster format (such as NetCDF), representing a raster using its own native classes, namely `xarray.Dataset` and `xarray.DataArray`\n",
        "\n",
        "## Vector data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "When introducing the packages for working with vector layers in Python, we are going to go from the complex class (vector layer), through the intermediate (geometry column), to the simple (geometry).\n",
        "As we will see, the three classes are hierarchical, meaning that the complex encompasses the simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A vector layer (class `GeoDataFrame`) contains a geometry column (class `GeoSeries`) as one of the columns\n",
        "* A geometry column (class `GeoSeries`) is composed of individual geometries (class `shapely`)\n",
        "\n",
        "The first two classes (`GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries`) are defined in package **geopandas**.\n",
        "The third class is defined in package **shapely**, which deals with individual geometries, and comprises on of the dependencies of the **geopandas** package.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector layers\n",
        "\n",
        "The typical data structure for vector data is a vector layer.\n",
        "There are several methods to work with vector layers in Python, ranging from low-level (e.g., **fiona**) to high-level (**geopandas**).\n",
        "In this book, we focus on **geopandas**.\n",
