        "Attribute data is non-spatial information associated with geographic (geometry) data.\n",
        "A bus stop provides a simple example: its position would typically be represented by latitude and longitude coordinates (geometry data), in addition to its name.\n",
        "The Elephant & Castle / New Kent Road bus stop in London, for example has coordinates of `-0.098` degrees longitude and `51.495` degrees latitude which can be represented as `POINT (-0.098 51.495)` using the Simple Feature representation described in @sec-spatial-class.\n",
        "Attributes, such as the name of the bus stop, are the topic of this chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example of an attribute is the elevation value for a specific grid cell in raster data.\n",
        "Unlike the vector data model, the raster data model stores the coordinate of the grid cell indirectly, meaning the distinction between attribute and spatial information is less clear.\n",
        "Think of a pixel in the 3rd row and the 4th column of a raster matrix: its spatial location is defined by its index in the matrix.\n",
        "In this case, we need to move four cells in the x direction (typically east/right on maps) and three cells in the y direction (typically south/down) from the origin.\n",
        "The raster's resolution is also important as it defines the distance for each x- and y-step.\n",
        "The resolution and the origin are stored in the raster's header, which is a vital component of raster datasets which specifies how pixels relate to geographic coordinates (see also @sec-spatial-operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter teaches how to manipulate geographic objects based on attributes such as the names of bus stops in a vector dataset and elevations of pixels in a raster dataset.\n",
        "For vector data, this means techniques such as subsetting and aggregation (see @sec-vector-attribute-subsetting and @sec-vector-attribute-aggregation).\n",
        "Moreover, @sec-vector-attribute-joining and @sec-creating-attributes-and-removing-spatial-information demonstrate how to join data onto simple feature objects using a shared ID and how to create new variables, respectively.\n",
        "Each of these operations has a spatial equivalent: `[` operator for subsetting a `(Geo)DataFrame` using a boolean `Series`, for example, is applicable both for subsetting objects based on their attribute and spatial relations derived using methods such as `.intersects`; you can also join attributes in two geographic datasets using spatial joins.\n",
        "This is good news: skills developed in this chapter are cross-transferable.\n",
        "@sec-spatial-operations extends the methods presented here to the spatial world.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a deep dive into various types of vector attribute operations in the next section, raster attribute data operations are covered in @sec-raster-subsetting, which demonstrates extracting cell values from one or more layer (raster subsetting).\n",
        "@sec-summarizing-raster-objects provides an overview of 'global' raster operations which can be used to summarize entire raster datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Vector attribute manipulation {#sec-vector-attribute-manipulation}\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned in @sec-vector-layers, vector layers (`GeoDataFrame`, from package **geopandas**) are basically extended tables (`DataFrame` from package **pandas**), the difference being that a vector layer has a geometry column.\n",
        "Therefore, all ordinary table-related operations from package **pandas** are supported for **geopandas** vector layers as well, as shown below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector attribute subsetting {#sec-vector-attribute-subsetting}\n",
        "\n",
        "**pandas** supports several subsetting interfaces, though the most [recommended](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38886080/python-pandas-series-why-use-loc) ones are `.loc`, which uses **pandas** indices, and `.iloc`, which uses (implicit) **numpy**-style numeric indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "In both cases, the method is followed by square brackets, and two indices, separated by a comma.\n",
        "Each index can be:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A specific value, as in `1`\n",
        "-   A `list`, as in `[0,2,4]`\n",

In expression #2, we omit the columns index, as well as the starting index, that is, `[:3]`, doing the same with less code. In expression #3, we are using the `.head` method to select the first N rows."
