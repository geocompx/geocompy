    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThis chapter outlines two fundamental geographic data models — vector and raster — and introduces the main Python packages for working with them. Before demonstrating their implementation in Python, we will introduce the theory behind each data model and the disciplines in which they predominate.\nThe vector data model (Section 1.2) represents the world using points, lines, and polygons. These have discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector datasets usually have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy). The raster data model (Section 1.3), on the other hand, divides the surface up into cells of constant size. Raster datasets are the basis of background images used in web-mapping and have been a vital source of geographic data since the origins of aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices. Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable, with many worldwide raster datasets available.\nWhich to use? The answer likely depends on your domain of application, and the datasets you have access to:\nPython has strong support for both data models. We will focus on shapely and geopandas for working with geograpic vector data, and rasterio for working with rasters.\nshapely is a “low-level” package for working with individual vector geometry objects. geopandas is a “high-level” package for working with geometry columns (GeoSeries objects), which internally contain shapely geometries, and with vector layers (GeoDataFrame objects). The geopandas ecosystem provides a comprehensive approach for working with vector layers in Python, with many packages building on it.\nThere are several partially overlapping packages for working with raster data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this book, we focus on the most prominent one: rasterio, which represents “simple” raster datasets with a combination of a numpy array, and a metadata object (dict) providing geographic metadata such as the coordinate system. xarray is a notable alternative to rasterio not covered in this book which uses native xarray.Dataset and xarray.DataArray classes to effectively represent complex raster datasets such as ‘NetCDF’ files with multiple bands and metadata.\nThere is much overlap in some fields and raster and vector datasets can be used together: ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster data. Furthermore, it is possible to convert between the two forms (see Chapter 5). Whether your work involves more use of vector or raster datasets, it is worth understanding the underlying data models before using them, as discussed in subsequent chapters.",

    "section": "1.2 Vector data",
    "text": "1.2 Vector data\nThe geographic vector data model is based on points located within a coordinate reference system (CRS). Points can represent self-standing features (e.g., the location of a bus stop), or they can be linked together to form more complex geometries such as lines and polygons. Most point geometries contain only two dimensions (3-dimensional CRSs may contain an additional \\(z\\) value, typically representing height above sea level).\nIn this system, London, for example, can be represented by the coordinates (-0.1,51.5). This means that its location is -0.1 degrees east and 51.5 degrees north of the origin. The origin, in this case, is at 0 degrees longitude (a prime meridian located at Greenwich) and 0 degrees latitude (the Equator) in a geographic (‘lon/lat’) CRS (Figure 1.1, left panel). The same point could also be approximated in a projected CRS with ‘Easting/Northing’ values of (530000,180000) in the British National Grid, meaning that London is located 530 \\(km\\) East and 180 \\(km\\) North of the origin of the CRS (Figure 1.1, right panel). The location of National Grid’s origin, in the sea beyond South West Peninsular, ensures that most locations in the UK have positive Easting and Northing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). The left plot represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0° longitude and latitude. The right plot represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula.\n\n\n\nThere is more to CRSs, as described in Section 1.4 and Chapter 6 but, for the purposes of this section, it is sufficient to know that coordinates consist of two numbers representing the distance from an origin, usually in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) dimensions.\ngeopandas (Bossche et al. 2023) provides classes for geographic vector data and a consistent command-line interface for reproducible geographic data analysis in Python. It also provides an interface to three mature libraries for geocomputation which, in combination, represent a strong foundation on which many geographic applications are built (including QGIS and R’s spatial ecosystem):\n\nGDAL, for reading, writing, and manipulating a wide range of geographic data formats, covered in Chapter 7\nPROJ, a powerful library for coordinate system transformations, which underlies the content covered in Chapter 6\nGEOS, a planar geometry engine for operations such as calculating buffers and centroids on data with a projected CRS, covered in Chapter 4\n\nTight integration with these geographic libraries makes reproducible geocomputation possible: an advantage of using a higher level language such as Python to access these libraries is that you do not need to know the intricacies of the low level components, enabling focus on the methods rather than the implementation.\n\n1.2.1 Vector data classes\nThe main classes for working with geographic vector data in Python are hierarchical, meaning the highest level ‘vector layer’ class is composed of simpler ‘geometry column’ and individual ‘geometry’ components. This section introduces them in order, starting with the highest level class. For many applications, the high level vector layer class, which are essentially a data frame with geometry columns, are all that’s needed. However, it’s important to understand the structure of vector geographic objects and their component pieces for more advanced applications. The three main vector geographic data classes in Python are:\n\nGeoDataFrame, a class representing vector layers, with a geometry column (class GeoSeries) as one of the columns\nGeoSeries, a class that is used to represent the geometry column in GeoDataFrame objects\nshapely geometry objects which represent individual geometries, such as a point or a polygon in GeoSeries objects\n\nThe first two classes (GeoDataFrame and GeoSeries) are defined in geopandas. The third class is defined in the shapely package, which deals with individual geometries, and is a main dependency of the geopandas package.\n\n\n1.2.2 Vector layers\nThe most commonly used geographic vector data structure is the vector layer. There are several approaches for working with vector layers in Python, ranging from low-level packages (e.g., osgeo, fiona) to the relatively high-level geopandas package that is the focus of this section. Before writing and running code for creating and working with geographic vector objects, we need to import geopandas (by convention as gpd for more concise code) and shapely.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport shapely\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nWe also limit the maximum number of printed rows to six, to save space, using the 'display.max_rows' option of pandas.\n\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 6)\n\nProjects often start by importing an existing vector layer saved as a GeoPackage (.gpkg) file, an ESRI Shapefile (.shp), or other geographic file format. The function gpd.read_file imports a GeoPackage file named world.gpkg located in the data directory of Python’s working directory into a GeoDataFrame named gdf.\n\ngdf = gpd.read_file('data/world.gpkg')\n\nThe result is an object of type (class) GeoDataFrame with 177 rows (features) and 11 columns, as shown in the output of the following code:\n\ntype(gdf)\n\ngeopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame\n\n\n\ngdf.shape\n\n(177, 11)\n\n\nThe GeoDataFrame class is an extension of the DataFrame class from the popular pandas package (McKinney 2010). This means we can treat non-spatial attributes from a vector layer as a table, and process them using the ordinary, i.e., non-spatial, established function methods. For example, standard data frame subsetting methods can be used. The code below creates a subset of the gdf dataset containing only the country name and the geometry.\n\ngdf = gdf[['name_long', 'geometry']]\ngdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nFiji\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55522,...\n\n\n1\nTanzania\nMULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n\n\n2\nWestern Sahara\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-8.66559 27.656...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nKosovo\nMULTIPOLYGON (((20.59025 41.855...\n\n\n175\nTrinidad and Tobago\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68 10.76, -...\n\n\n176\nSouth Sudan\nMULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.5091...\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThe following expression creates a subdataset based on a condition, such as equality of the value in the 'name_long' column to the string 'Egypt'.\n\ngdf[gdf['name_long'] == 'Egypt']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n163\nEgypt\nMULTIPOLYGON (((36.86623 22, 36...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to get a sense of the spatial component of the vector layer, it can be plotted using the .plot method (Figure 1.2).\n\ngdf.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Basic plot of a GeoDataFrame\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive maps of GeoDataFrame objects can be created with the .explore method, as illustrated in Figure 1.3 which was created with the following command:\n\ngdf.explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Basic interactive map with .explore\n\n\n\n\nA subset of the data can be also plotted in a similar fashion.\n\ngdf[gdf['name_long'] == 'Egypt'].explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Interactive map of a GeoDataFrame subset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Geometry columns\nThe geometry column of class GeoSeries is an essential column in a GeoDataFrame. It contains the geometric part of the vector layer, and is the basis for all spatial operations. This column can be accessed by name, which typically (e.g., when reading from a file) is 'geometry', as in gdf['geometry']. However, the recommendation is to use the fixed .geometry property, which refers to the geometry column regardless whether its name is 'geometry' or not. In the case of the gdf object, the geometry column contains 'MultiPolygon's associated with each country.\n\ngdf.geometry\n\n0      MULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55522,...\n1      MULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n2      MULTIPOLYGON (((-8.66559 27.656...\n                      ...                \n174    MULTIPOLYGON (((20.59025 41.855...\n175    MULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68 10.76, -...\n176    MULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.5091...\nName: geometry, Length: 177, dtype: geometry\n\n\nThe geometry column also contains the spatial reference information, if any (also accessible with the shortcut gdf.crs).\n\ngdf.geometry.crs\n\n&lt;Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4326&gt;\nName: WGS 84\nAxis Info [ellipsoidal]:\n- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)\n- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)\nArea of Use:\n- name: World.\n- bounds: (-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0)\nDatum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\n- Ellipsoid: WGS 84\n- Prime Meridian: Greenwich\n\n\nMany geometry operations, such as calculating the centroid, buffer, or bounding box of each feature, involve just the geometry. Applying this type of operation on a GeoDataFrame is therefore basically a shortcut to applying it on the GeoSeries object in the geometry column. For example, the two following commands return exactly the same result, a GeoSeries with country bounding box polygons (using the .envelope method).\n\ngdf.envelope\n\n0      POLYGON ((-180 -18.28799, 179.9...\n1      POLYGON ((29.34 -11.72094, 40.3...\n2      POLYGON ((-17.06342 20.99975, -...\n                      ...                \n174    POLYGON ((20.0707 41.84711, 21....\n175    POLYGON ((-61.95 10, -60.895 10...\n176    POLYGON ((23.88698 3.50917, 35....\nLength: 177, dtype: geometry\n\n\n\ngdf.geometry.envelope\n\n0      POLYGON ((-180 -18.28799, 179.9...\n1      POLYGON ((29.34 -11.72094, 40.3...\n2      POLYGON ((-17.06342 20.99975, -...\n                      ...                \n174    POLYGON ((20.0707 41.84711, 21....\n175    POLYGON ((-61.95 10, -60.895 10...\n176    POLYGON ((23.88698 3.50917, 35....\nLength: 177, dtype: geometry\n\n\nNote that .envelope, and other similar operators in geopandas such as .centroid (Section 4.2.2), .buffer (Section 4.2.3) or .convex_hull, return only the geometry (i.e., a GeoSeries), not a GeoDataFrame with the original attribute data. In case we want the latter, we can create a copy of the GeoDataFrame and then “overwrite” its geometry (or, we can overwrite the geometries directly in case we do not need the original ones, as in gdf.geometry=gdf.envelope).\n\ngdf2 = gdf.copy()\ngdf2.geometry = gdf.envelope\ngdf2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nFiji\nPOLYGON ((-180 -18.28799, 179.9...\n\n\n1\nTanzania\nPOLYGON ((29.34 -11.72094, 40.3...\n\n\n2\nWestern Sahara\nPOLYGON ((-17.06342 20.99975, -...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nKosovo\nPOLYGON ((20.0707 41.84711, 21....\n\n\n175\nTrinidad and Tobago\nPOLYGON ((-61.95 10, -60.895 10...\n\n\n176\nSouth Sudan\nPOLYGON ((23.88698 3.50917, 35....\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nAnother useful property of the geometry column is the geometry type, as shown in the following code. Note that the types of geometries contained in a geometry column (and, thus, a vector layer) are not necessarily the same for every row. It is possible to have multiple geometry types in a single GeoSeries. Accordingly, the .type property returns a Series (with values of type str, i.e., strings), rather than a single value (the same can be done with the shortcut gdf.geom_type).\n\ngdf.geometry.type\n\n0      MultiPolygon\n1      MultiPolygon\n2      MultiPolygon\n           ...     \n174    MultiPolygon\n175    MultiPolygon\n176    MultiPolygon\nLength: 177, dtype: object\n\n\nTo summarize the occurrence of different geometry types in a geometry column, we can use the pandas .value_counts method. In this case, we see that the gdf layer contains only 'MultiPolygon' geometries.\n\ngdf.geometry.type.value_counts()\n\nMultiPolygon    177\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nA GeoDataFrame can also have multiple GeoSeries columns, as demonstrated in the following code section.\n\ngdf['bbox'] = gdf.envelope\ngdf['polygon'] = gdf.geometry\ngdf\n\nOnly one geometry column at a time is “active”, in the sense that it is being accessed in operations involving the geometries (such as .centroid, .crs, etc.). To switch the active geometry column from one GeoSeries column to another, we use .set_geometry. Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6 shows interactive maps of the gdf layer with the 'bbox' and 'polygon' geometry columns activated, respectively.\n\ngdf = gdf.set_geometry('bbox')\ngdf.explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Switching to the 'bbox' geometry column in the world layer, and plotting it\n\n\n\n\n\ngdf = gdf.set_geometry('polygon')\ngdf.explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Switching to the 'polygons' geometry column in the world layer, and plotting it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 The Simple Features standard\nGeometries are the basic building blocks of vector layers. Although the Simple Features standard defines about 20 types of geometries, we will focus on the seven most commonly used types: POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOLYGON and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION. A useful list of possible geometry types can be found in R’s sf package documentation.\nSimple feature geometries can be represented by well-known binary (WKB) and well-known text (WKT) encodings.  WKB representations are usually hexadecimal strings easily readable for computers, and this is why GIS software and spatial databases use WKB to transfer and store geometry objects. WKT, on the other hand, is a human-readable text markup description of Simple Features. Both formats are exchangeable, and if we present one, we will naturally choose the WKT representation.\nThe foundation of each geometry type is the point. A point is simply a coordinate in 2D, 3D, or 4D space such as shown in Figure 1.7.\nPOINT (5 2)\nA linestring is a sequence of points with a straight line connecting the points (Figure 1.8).\nLINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)\nA polygon is a sequence of points that form a closed, non-intersecting ring. Closed means that the first and the last point of a polygon have the same coordinates (Figure 1.9).\nPOLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))\nSo far we have created geometries with only one geometric entity per feature. However, the Simple Features standard allows multiple geometries to exist within a single feature, using “multi” versions of each geometry type, as illustrated in Figure 1.10, Figure 1.11, and Figure 1.12.\nMULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2)\nMULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)))\nFinally, a geometry collection can contain any combination of geometries of the other six types, such as the combination of a multipoint and linestring shown below (Figure 1.13).\nGEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2),\n                    LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))\n\n\n1.2.5 Geometries\nEach element in the geometry column (GeoSeries) is a geometry object of class shapely (Gillies et al. 2007--). For example, here is one specific geometry selected by implicit index (Canada, the 4th element in gdf’s geometry column).\n\ngdf.geometry.iloc[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also select a specific geometry based on the 'name_long' attribute (i.e., the 1st and only element in the subset of gdf where the country name is equal to Egypt):\n\ngdf[gdf['name_long'] == 'Egypt'].geometry.iloc[0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shapely package is compatible with the Simple Features standard (Section 1.2.4). Accordingly, seven types of geometry types are supported. The following section demonstrates creating a shapely geometry of each type from scratch. In the first example (a 'Point') we show two types of inputs to create a geometry: a list of coordinates or a string in the WKT format. In the examples for the remaining geometries we use the former approach.\nCreating a 'Point' geometry from a list of coordinates uses the shapely.Point function in the following expression (Figure 1.7).\n\npoint = shapely.Point([5, 2])\npoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: A Point geometry (created either from a list or WKT)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use shapely.from_wkt to transform a WKT string to a shapely geometry object. Here is an example of creating the same 'Point' geometry from WKT (Figure 1.7).\n\npoint = shapely.from_wkt('POINT (5 2)')\npoint\n\nA 'LineString' geometry can be created based on a list of coordinate tuples or lists (Figure 1.8).\n\nlinestring = shapely.LineString([(1,5), (4,4), (4,1), (2,2), (3,2)])\nlinestring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: A LineString geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of a 'Polygon' geometry is similar, but our first and last coordinate must be the same, to ensure that the polygon is closed. Note that in the following example, there is one list of coordinates that defines the exterior outer hull of the polygon, followed by a list of lists of coordinates that define the holes (if any) in the polygon (Figure 1.9).\n\npolygon = shapely.Polygon(\n    [(1,5), (2,2), (4,1), (4,4), (1,5)],  ## Exterior\n    [[(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4)]]  ## Hole(s)\n)\npolygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: A Polygon geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'MultiPoint' geometry is also created from a list of coordinate tuples (Figure 1.10), where each element represents a single point.\n\nmultipoint = shapely.MultiPoint([(5,2), (1,3), (3,4), (3,2)])\nmultipoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: A MultiPoint geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'MultiLineString' geometry, on the other hand, has one list of coordinates for each line in the MultiLineString (Figure 1.11).\n\nmultilinestring = shapely.MultiLineString([\n    [(1,5), (4,4), (4,1), (2,2), (3,2)],  ## 1st sequence\n    [(1,2), (2,4)]  ## 2nd sequence, etc.\n])\nmultilinestring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: A MultiLineString geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'MultiPolygon' geometry (Figure 1.12) is created from a list of Polygon geometries. For example, here we are creating a 'MultiPolygon' with two parts, both without holes.\n\nmultipolygon = shapely.MultiPolygon([\n    [[(1,5), (2,2), (4,1), (4,4), (1,5)], []],  ## Polygon 1 \n    [[(0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)], []]   ## Polygon 2, etc.\n])\nmultipolygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: A MultiPolygon geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the required input has four hierarchical levels, it may be more clear to create the single-part 'Polygon' geometries in advance, using the respective function (shapely.Polygon), and then pass them to shapely.MultiPolygon (Figure 1.12). (The same technique can be used with the other shapely.Multi* functions.)\n\nmultipolygon = shapely.MultiPolygon([\n    shapely.Polygon([(1,5), (2,2), (4,1), (4,4), (1,5)]),  ## Polygon 1 \n    shapely.Polygon([(0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)])   ## Polygon 2, etc.\n])\nmultipolygon\n\nAnd, finally, a 'GeometryCollection' geometry is a list with one or more of the other six geometry types (Figure 1.13):\n\ngeometrycollection = shapely.GeometryCollection([multipoint, multilinestring])\ngeometrycollection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: A GeometryCollection geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nshapely geometries act as atomic units of vector data, meaning that there is no concept of geometry sets: each operation accepts individual geometry object(s) as input, and returns an individual geometry as output. (The GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame objects, defined in geopandas, are used to deal with sets of shapely geometries, collectively.) For example, the following expression calculates the difference (see Section 4.2.5) between the buffered (see Section 4.2.3) multipolygon (using distance of 0.2) and itself (Figure 1.14):\n\nmultipolygon.buffer(0.2).difference(multipolygon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: The difference between a buffered MultiPolygon and itself\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the last few figures, a shapely geometry object is automatically evaluated to a small image of the geometry (when using an interface capable of displaying it, such as Jupyter Notebook). To print the WKT string instead, we can use the print function:\n\nprint(linestring)\n\nLINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)\n\n\nFinally, it is important to note that raw coordinates of shapely geometries are accessible through a combination of the .coords, .geoms, .exterior, and .interiors properties (depending on the geometry type). These access methods are helpful when we need to develop our own spatial operators for specific tasks. For example, the following expression returns the list of all coordinates of the polygon geometry exterior:\n\nlist(polygon.exterior.coords)\n\n[(1.0, 5.0), (2.0, 2.0), (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 4.0), (1.0, 5.0)]\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Vector layer from scratch\nIn the previous sections, we started with a vector layer (GeoDataFrame), from an existing GeoPackage file, and “decomposed” it to extract the geometry column (GeoSeries, Section 1.2.3) and separate geometries (shapely, see Section 1.2.5). In this section, we will demonstrate the opposite process, constructing a GeoDataFrame from shapely geometries, combined into a GeoSeries. This will help you better understand the structure of a GeoDataFrame, and may come in handy when you need to programmatically construct simple vector layers, such as a line between two given points.\nVector layers consist of two main parts: geometries and non-geographic attributes. Figure 1.15 shows how a GeoDataFrame object is created—geometries come from a GeoSeries object (which consists of shapely geometries), while attributes are taken from Series objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Creating a GeoDataFrame from scratch\n\n\n\nThe final result, a vector layer (GeoDataFrame) is therefore a hierarchical structure (Figure 1.16), containing the geometry column (GeoSeries), which in turn contains geometries (shapely). Each of the “internal” components can be accessed, or “extracted”, which is sometimes necessary, as we will see later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.16: Structure of a GeoDataFrame\n\n\n\nNon-geographic attributes may represent the name of the feature, and other attributes such as measured values, groups, etc. To illustrate attributes, we will represent a temperature of 25°C in London on June 21st, 2023. This example contains a geometry (the coordinates), and three attributes with three different classes (place name, temperature and date). Objects of class GeoDataFrame represent such data by combining the attributes (Series) with the simple feature geometry column (GeoSeries). First, we create a point geometry, which we know how to do from Section 1.2.5 (Figure 1.17).\n\nlnd_point = shapely.Point(0.1, 51.5)\nlnd_point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: A shapely point representing London\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create a GeoSeries (of length 1), containing the point and a CRS definition, in this case WGS84 (defined using its EPSG code 4326). Also note that the shapely geometries go into a list, to illustrate that there can be more than one geometry unlike in this example.\n\nlnd_geom = gpd.GeoSeries([lnd_point], crs=4326)\nlnd_geom\n\n0    POINT (0.1 51.5)\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nNext, we combine the GeoSeries with other attributes into a dict. The geometry column is a GeoSeries, named geometry. The other attributes (if any) may be defined using list or Series objects. Here, for simplicity, we use the list option for defining the three attributes name, temperature, and date. Again, note that the list can be of length &gt;1, in case we are creating a layer with more than one feature (i.e., multiple rows).\n\nlnd_data = {\n  'name': ['London'],\n  'temperature': [25],\n  'date': ['2023-06-21'],\n  'geometry': lnd_geom\n}\n\nFinally, the dict can be coverted to a GeoDataFrame object, as shown in the following code.\n\nlnd_layer = gpd.GeoDataFrame(lnd_data)\nlnd_layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ntemperature\ndate\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nLondon\n25\n2023-06-21\nPOINT (0.1 51.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat just happened? First, the coordinates were used to create the simple feature geometry (shapely). Second, the geometry was converted into a simple feature geometry column (GeoSeries), with a CRS. Third, attributes were combined with GeoSeries. This results in an GeoDataFrame object, named lnd_layer.\nTo illustrate how does creating a layer with more than one feature looks like, here is an example where we create a layer with two points, London and Paris.\n\nlnd_point = shapely.Point(0.1, 51.5)\nparis_point = shapely.Point(2.3, 48.9)\ntowns_geom = gpd.GeoSeries([lnd_point, paris_point], crs=4326)\ntowns_data = {\n  'name': ['London', 'Paris'],\n  'temperature': [25, 27],\n  'date': ['2013-06-21', '2013-06-21'],\n  'geometry': towns_geom\n}\ntowns_layer = gpd.GeoDataFrame(towns_data)\ntowns_layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ntemperature\ndate\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nLondon\n25\n2013-06-21\nPOINT (0.1 51.5)\n\n\n1\nParis\n27\n2013-06-21\nPOINT (2.3 48.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we are able to create an interactive map of the towns_layer object (Figure 1.18). To make the points easier to see, we are customizing a fill color and size (we elaborate on .explore options in Section 8.3).\n\ntowns_layer.explore(color='red', marker_kwds={'radius': 10})\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 1.18: towns_layer, created from scratch, visualized using .explore\n\n\n\n\nA spatial (point) layer can be also created from a DataFrame object (package pandas) that contains columns with coordinates. To demonstrate, we hereby first create a GeoSeries object from the coordinates, and then combine it with the DataFrame to form a GeoDataFrame.\n\ntowns_table = pd.DataFrame({\n  'name': ['London', 'Paris'],\n  'temperature': [25, 27],\n  'date': ['2017-06-21', '2017-06-21'],\n  'x': [0.1, 2.3],\n  'y': [51.5, 48.9]\n})\ntowns_geom = gpd.points_from_xy(towns_table['x'], towns_table['y'])\ntowns_layer = gpd.GeoDataFrame(towns_table, geometry=towns_geom, crs=4326)\n\nThe output gives the same result as previous towns_layer. This approach is particularly useful when we need to read data from a CSV file, e.g., using pd.read_csv, and want to turn the resulting DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame (see another example in Section 3.2.3).\n\n\n1.2.7 Derived numeric properties\nVector layers are characterized by two essential derived numeric properties: length (.length)—applicable to lines, and area (.area)—applicable to polygons. Area and length can be calculated for any data structures discussed above, either a shapely geometry, in which case the returned value is a number, or for GeoSeries or DataFrame, in which case the returned value is a numeric Series.\n\nlinestring.length\n\n9.39834563766817\n\n\n\nmultipolygon.area\n\n8.0\n\n\n\ngpd.GeoSeries([point, linestring, polygon, multipolygon]).area\n\n0    0.0\n1    0.0\n2    6.0\n3    8.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\nLike all numeric calculations in geopandas, the results assume a planar CRS and are returned in its native units. This means that length and area measurements for geometries in WGS84 (crs=4326) are returned in decimal degrees and essentially meaningless (to see the warning, try running gdf.area).\nTo obtain meaningful length and area measurements for data in a geographic CRS, the geometries first need to be transformed to a projected CRS (see Section 6.7) applicable to the area of interest. For example, the area of Slovenia can be calculated in the UTM zone 33N CRS (crs=32633). The result is in \\(m^2\\), the units of the UTM zone 33N CRS.\n\ngdf[gdf['name_long'] == 'Slovenia'].to_crs(32633).area\n\n150    1.910410e+10\ndtype: float64",

    "text": "1.3 Raster data\nThe spatial raster data model represents the world with the continuous grid of cells (often also called pixels; Figure 1.19 (A)). This data model often refers to so-called regular grids, in which each cell has the same, constant size—and we will focus only on regular grids in this book. However, several other types of grids exist, including rotated, sheared, rectilinear, and curvilinear grids (see Chapter 1 of Pebesma and Bivand (2022) or Chapter 2 of Tennekes and Nowosad (2022)).\nThe raster data model usually consists of a raster header (or metadata) and a matrix (with rows and columns) representing equally spaced cells (often also called pixels; Figure 1.19 (A)). The raster header defines the coordinate reference system, the the origin and the resolution. The origin (or starting point) is typically the coordinate of the lower-left corner of the matrix. The metadata defines the the origin, and the cell size, i.e., resolution. Combined with the column and row count, the extent can also be derived. The matrix representation avoids storing explicitly the coordinates for the four corner points (in fact it only stores one coordinate, namely the origin) of each cell, as would be the case for rectangular vector polygons. This and map algebra (Section 3.3.2) makes raster processing much more efficient and faster than vector data processing. However, in contrast to vector data, the cell of one raster layer can only hold a single value. The cell values are numeric, representing either a continuous or a categorical variable (Figure 1.19 (C)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Raster data types: (A) cell IDs, (B) cell values, (C) a colored raster map\n\n\n\nRaster maps usually represent continuous phenomena such as elevation, temperature, population density or spectral data. Discrete features such as soil or land-cover classes can also be represented in the raster data model. Both uses of raster datasets are illustrated in Figure 1.20, which shows how the borders of discrete features may become blurred in raster datasets. Depending on the nature of the application, vector representations of discrete features may be more suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Examples of continuous and categorical rasters\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, working with rasters in Python is less organized around one comprehensive package as compared to the case for vector layers and geopandas. Instead, several packages provide alternative subsets of methods for working with raster data.\nThe two most notable approaches for working with rasters in Python are provided by rasterio and rioxarray packages. As we will see shortly, they differ in scope and underlying data models. Specifically, rasterio represents rasters as numpy arrays associated with a separate object holding the spatial metadata. The rioxarray package, a wrapper of rasterio, however, represents rasters with xarray “extended” arrays, which are an extension of numpy array designed to hold axis labels and attributes in the same object, together with the array of raster values. Similar approaches are provided by less well-known xarray-spatial and geowombat packages. Comparatively, rasterio is more well-established, but it is more low-level (which has both advantages and distadvantages).\nAll of the above-mentioned packages, however, are not exhaustive in the same way geopandas is. For example, when working with rasterio, more packages may be needed to accomplish common tasks such as zonal statistics (package rasterstats) or calculating topographic indices (package richdem). \nIn the following two sections, we introduce rasterio, which is the raster-related package we are going to work with through the rest of the book.\n\n1.3.1 Using rasterio\nTo work with the rasterio package, we first need to import it. Additionally, as the raster data is stored within numpy arrays, we import the numpy package and make all its functions accessible for effective data manipulation. Finally, we import the rasterio.plot sub-module for its rasterio.plot.show function that allows for quick visualization of rasters.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport rasterio\nimport rasterio.plot\n\nRasters are typically imported from existing files. When working with rasterio, importing a raster is actually a two-step process:\n\nFirst, we open a raster file “connection” using rasterio.open\nSecond, we read raster values from the connection using the .read method\n\nThis type of separation is analogous to basic Python functions for reading from files, such as open and .readline to read from a text file. The rationale is that we do not always want to read all information from the file into memory, which is particularly important as rasters size can be larger than RAM size. Accordingly, the second step (.read) is selective, meaning that the user can fine tune the subset of values (bands, rows/columns, resolution, etc.) that are actually being read. For example, we may want to read just one raster band rather than reading all bands.\nIn the first step, we pass a file path to the rasterio.open function to create a DatasetReader file connection, hereby named src. For this example, we use a single-band raster representing elevation in Zion National Park, stored in srtm.tif.\n\nsrc = rasterio.open('data/srtm.tif')\nsrc\n\n&lt;open DatasetReader name='data/srtm.tif' mode='r'&gt;\n\n\nTo get a first impression of the raster values, we can plot the raster using the rasterio.plot.show function (Figure 1.21):\n\nrasterio.plot.show(src);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Basic plot of a raster, the data are coming from a rasterio file connection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DatasetReader contains the raster metadata, that is, all of the information other than the raster values. Let’s examine it with the .meta property.\n\nsrc.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint16',\n 'nodata': 65535.0,\n 'width': 465,\n 'height': 457,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n        0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)}\n\n\nNamely, it allows us to see the following properties, which we will elaborate on below, and in later chapters:\n\ndriver—The raster file format (see Section 7.6.2)\ndtype—Data type (see Table 7.2)\nnodata—The value being used as “No Data” flag (see Section 7.6.2)\nDimensions:\n\nwidth—Number of columns\nheight—Number of rows\ncount—Number of bands\n\ncrs—Coordinate reference system (see Section 6.3)\ntransform—The raster affine transformation matrix\n\nThe last item (i.e., transform) deserves more attention. To position a raster in geographical space, in addition to the CRS, we must specify the raster origin (\\(x_{min}\\), \\(y_{max}\\)) and resolution (\\(delta_{x}\\), \\(delta_{y}\\)). In the transformation matrix notation, assuming a regular grid, these data items are stored as follows:\nAffine(delta_x, 0.0, x_min,\n       0.0, delta_y, y_max)\nNote that, by convention, raster y-axis origin is set to the maximum value (\\(y_{max}\\)) rather than the minimum, and, accordingly, the y-axis resolution (\\(delta_{y}\\)) is negative. In other words, since the origin is in the top-left corner, advancing along the y-axis is done through negative steps (downwards).\nIn the second step, the .read method of the DatasetReader is used to read the actual raster values. Importantly, we can read:\n\nAll layers (as in .read())\nA particular layer, passing a numeric index (as in .read(1))\nA subset of layers, passing a list of indices (as in .read([1,2]))\n\nNote that the layer indices start from 1, contrary to the Python convention of the first index being 0.\nThe object returned by .read is a numpy array (Harris et al. 2020), with either two or three dimensions:\n\nThree dimensions, when reading more than one layer (e.g., .read() or .read([1,2])). In such case, the dimensions pattern is (layers, rows, columns)\nTwo dimensions, when reading one specific layer (e.g., .read(1)). In such case, the dimensions pattern is (rows, columns)\n\nLet’s read the first (and only) layer from the srtm.tif raster, using the file connection object src and the .read method.\n\nsrc.read(1)\n\narray([[1728, 1718, 1715, ..., 2654, 2674, 2685],\n       [1737, 1727, 1717, ..., 2649, 2677, 2693],\n       [1739, 1734, 1727, ..., 2644, 2672, 2695],\n       ...,\n       [1326, 1328, 1329, ..., 1777, 1778, 1775],\n       [1320, 1323, 1326, ..., 1771, 1770, 1772],\n       [1319, 1319, 1322, ..., 1768, 1770, 1772]], dtype=uint16)\n\n\nThe result is a two-dimensional numpy array where each value represents the elevation of the corresponding pixel.\nThe relation between a rasterio file connection and the derived properties is summarized in Figure 1.22. The file connection (created with rasterio.open) gives access to the two components of raster data: the metadata (via the .meta property) and the values (via the .read method).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Creating a GeoDataFrame from scratch\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Raster from scratch\nIn this section, we are going to demonstrate the creation of rasters from scratch. We will construct two small rasters, elev and grain, which we will use in examples later in the book. Unlike creating a vector layer (see Section 1.2.6), creating a raster from scratch is rarely needed in practice because aligning a raster with the proper spatial extent is challenging to do programmatically (“georeferencing” tools in GIS software are a better fit for the job). Nevertheless, the examples will be helpful to become more familiar with the rasterio data structures.\nConceptually, a raster is an array combined with georeferencing information, whereas the latter comprises:\n\nA transformation matrix, containing the origin and resolution, thus linking pixel indices with coordinates in a particular coordinate system\nA CRS definition, specifying the association of that coordinate system with the surface of the earth (optional)\n\nTherefore, to create a raster, we first need to have an array with the values, and then supplement it with the georeferencing information. Let’s create the arrays elev and grain. The elev array is a \\(6 \\times 6\\) array with sequential values from 1 to 36. It can be created as follows using the np.arange function and .reshape method from numpy.\n\nelev = np.arange(1, 37, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(6, 6)\nelev\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nThe grain array represents a categorical raster with values 0, 1, 2, corresponding to categories “clay”, “silt”, “sand”, respectively. We will create it from a specific arrangement of pixel values, using numpy’s np.array and .reshape.\n\nv = [\n  1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, \n  0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, \n  0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, \n  0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, \n  1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, \n  2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2\n]\ngrain = np.array(v, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(6, 6)\ngrain\n\narray([[1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2],\n       [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1],\n       [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\n       [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n       [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n       [2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nNote that in both cases, we are using the uint8 (unsigned integer in 8 bits, i.e., 0-255) data type, which is sufficient to represent all possible values of the given rasters (see Table 7.2). This is the recommended approach for a minimal memory footprint.\nWhat is missing now is the georeferencing information (see Section 1.3.1). In this case, since the rasters are arbitrary, we also set up an arbitrary transformation matrix, where:\n\nThe origin (\\(x_{min}\\), \\(y_{max}\\)) is at -1.5,1.5\nThe raster resolution (\\(delta_{x}\\), \\(delta_{y}\\)) is 0.5,-0.5\n\nWe can add this information using rasterio.transform.from_origin, and specifying west, north, xsize, and ysize parameters. The resulting transformation matrix object is hereby named new_transform.\n\nnew_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=-1.5, \n    north=1.5, \n    xsize=0.5, \n    ysize=0.5\n)\nnew_transform\n\nAffine(0.5, 0.0, -1.5,\n       0.0, -0.5, 1.5)\n\n\nNote that, confusingly, \\(delta_{y}\\) (i.e., ysize) is defined in rasterio.transform.from_origin using a positive value (0.5), even though it is, in fact, negative (-0.5).\nThe raster can now be plotted in its coordinate system, passing the array elev along with the transformation matrix new_transform to rasterio.plot.show (Figure 1.23).\n\nrasterio.plot.show(elev, transform=new_transform);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: Plot of the elev raster, a minimal example of a continuous raster, created from scratch\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grain raster can be plotted the same way, as we are going to use the same transformation matrix for it as well (Figure 1.24).\n\nrasterio.plot.show(grain, transform=new_transform);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: Plot of the grain raster, a minimal example of a categorical raster, created from scratch\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we have two rasters, each composed of an array and related transformation matrix. We can work with the raster using rasterio by:\n\nPassing the transformation matrix wherever actual raster pixel coordinates are important (such as in function rasterio.plot.show above)\nKeeping in mind that any other layer we use in the analysis is in the same CRS\n\nFinally, to export the raster for permanent storage, along with the spatial metadata, we need to go through the following steps:\n\nCreate a raster file connection (where we set the transform and the CRS, among other settings)\nWrite the array with raster values into the connection\nClose the connection\n\nDon’t worry if the code below is unclear; the concepts related to writing raster data to file will be explained in Section 7.6.2. For now, for completeness, and also to use these rasters in subsequent chapters without having to re-create them from scratch, we just provide the code for exporting the elev and grain rasters into the output directory. In the case of elev, we do it as follows with the rasterio.open, .write, and .close functions and methods of the rasterio package.\n\nnew_dataset = rasterio.open(\n    'output/elev.tif', 'w', \n    driver='GTiff',\n    height=elev.shape[0],\n    width=elev.shape[1],\n    count=1,\n    dtype=elev.dtype,\n    crs=4326,\n    transform=new_transform\n)\nnew_dataset.write(elev, 1)\nnew_dataset.close()\n\nNote that the CRS we (arbitrarily) set for the elev raster is WGS84, defined using crs=4326 according to the EPSG code.\nExporting the grain raster is done in the same way, with the only differences being the file name and the array we write into the connection.\n\nnew_dataset = rasterio.open(\n    'output/grain.tif', 'w', \n    driver='GTiff',\n    height=grain.shape[0],\n    width=grain.shape[1],\n    count=1,\n    dtype=grain.dtype,\n    crs=4326,\n    transform=new_transform\n)\nnew_dataset.write(grain, 1)\nnew_dataset.close()\n\nAs a result, the files elev.tif and grain.tif are written into the output directory. We are going to use these small raster files later on in the examples (for example, Section 2.3.1).\nNote that the transform matrices and dimensions of elev and grain are identical. This means that the rasters are overlapping, and can be combined into one two-band raster, processed in raster algebra operations (Section 3.3.2), etc.",

    "section": "1.4 Coordinate Reference Systems",
    "text": "1.4 Coordinate Reference Systems\nVector and raster spatial data types share concepts intrinsic to spatial data. Perhaps the most fundamental of these is the Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth (or other bodies). CRSs are either geographic or projected, as introduced at the beginning of this chapter (Section 1.2). This section explains each type, laying the foundations for Chapter 6, which provides a deep dive into setting, transforming, and querying CRSs.\n\n1.4.1 Geographic coordinate systems\nGeographic coordinate systems identify any location on the Earth’s surface using two values—longitude and latitude (see left panel of Figure 1.26). Longitude is a location in the East-West direction in angular distance from the Prime Meridian plane, while latitude is an angular distance North or South of the equatorial plane. Distances in geographic CRSs are therefore not measured in meters. This has important consequences, as demonstrated in Chapter 6.\nA spherical or ellipsoidal surface represents the surface of the Earth in geographic coordinate systems. Spherical models assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere of a given radius—they have the advantage of simplicity, but, at the same time, they are inaccurate: the Earth is not a sphere! Ellipsoidal models are defined by two parameters: the equatorial radius and the polar radius. These are suitable because the Earth is compressed: the equatorial radius is around 11.5 \\(km\\) longer than the polar radius.  The Earth is not an ellipsoid either, but it is a better approximation than a sphere.\nEllipsoids are part of a broader component of CRSs: the datum. It contains information on what ellipsoid to use and the precise relationship between the Cartesian coordinates and location on the Earth’s surface. There are two types of datum—geocentric (such as WGS84) and local (such as NAD83). You can see examples of these two types of datums in Figure 1.25. Black lines represent a geocentric datum, whose center is located in the Earth’s center of gravity and is not optimized for a specific location. In a local datum, shown as a purple dashed line, the ellipsoidal surface is shifted to align with the surface at a particular location. These allow local variations on Earth’s surface, such as large mountain ranges, to be accounted for in a local CRS. This can be seen in Figure 1.25, where the local datum is fitted to the area of Philippines, but is misaligned with most of the rest of the planet’s surface. Both datums in Figure 1.25 are put on top of a geoid—a model of global mean sea level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.25: Geocentric and local geodetic datums shown on top of a geoid (in false color and the vertical exaggeration by 10,000 scale factor). Image of the geoid is adapted from the work of (Ince et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Projected coordinate reference systems\nAll projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS, described in the previous section, and rely on map projections to convert the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into Easting and Northing (x and y) values in a projected CRS. Projected CRSs are based on Cartesian coordinates on an implicitly flat surface (see right panel of Figure 1.26). They have an origin, x and y axes, and a linear unit of measurement such as meters.\nThis transition cannot be done without adding some deformations. Therefore, some properties of the Earth’s surface are distorted in this process, such as area, direction, distance, and shape. A projected coordinate system can preserve only one or two of those properties. Projections are often named based on a property they preserve: equal-area preserves area, azimuthal preserves direction, equidistant preserves distance, and conformal preserves local shape.\nThere are three main groups of projection types: conic, cylindrical, and planar (azimuthal). In a conic projection, the Earth’s surface is projected onto a cone along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency. Distortions are minimized along the tangency lines and rise with the distance from those lines in this projection. Therefore, it is best suited for maps of mid-latitude areas. A cylindrical projection maps the surface onto a cylinder. This projection could also be created by touching the Earth’s surface along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency. Cylindrical projections are used most often when mapping the entire world. A planar projection projects data onto a flat surface touching the globe at a point or along a line of tangency. It is typically used in mapping polar regions.\n\n\n1.4.3 CRS in Python\nLike most open-source geospatial software, the geopandas and rasterio packages use the PROJ software for CRS definition and calculations. The pyproj package is a low-level interface to PROJ. Using its functions, such as get_codes and from_epsg, we can examine the list of projections supported by PROJ.\n\nimport pyproj\nepsg_codes = pyproj.get_codes('EPSG', 'CRS')  ## Supported EPSG codes\nepsg_codes[:5]  ## Print first five supported EPSG codes\n\n['10150', '10151', '10156', '10157', '10158']\n\n\n\npyproj.CRS.from_epsg(4326)  ## Printout of WGS84 CRS (EPSG:4326)\n\n&lt;Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4326&gt;\nName: WGS 84\nAxis Info [ellipsoidal]:\n- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)\n- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)\nArea of Use:\n- name: World.\n- bounds: (-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0)\nDatum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\n- Ellipsoid: WGS 84\n- Prime Meridian: Greenwich\n\n\nA quick summary of different projections, their types, properties, and suitability can be found at https://www.geo-projections.com/.  We will expand on CRSs and explain how to project from one CRS to another in Chapter 6. But, for now, it is sufficient to know:\n\nThat coordinate systems are a key component of geographic objects\nKnowing which CRS your data is in, and whether it is in geographic (lon/lat) or projected (typically meters), is important and has consequences for how Python handles spatial and geometry operations\nCRSs of geopandas (vector layer or geometry column) and rasterio (raster) objects can be queried with the .crs property\n\nHere is a demonstration of the last bullet point, where we import a vector layer and figure out its CRS (in this case, a projected CRS, namely UTM Zone 12) using the .crs property.\n\nzion = gpd.read_file('data/zion.gpkg')\nzion.crs\n\n&lt;Bound CRS: PROJCS[\"UTM Zone 12, Northern Hemisphere\",GEOGCS[\" ...&gt;\nName: UTM Zone 12, Northern Hemisphere\nAxis Info [cartesian]:\n- [east]: Easting (Meter)\n- [north]: Northing (Meter)\nArea of Use:\n- undefined\nCoordinate Operation:\n- name: Transformation from GRS 1980(IUGG, 1980) to WGS84\n- method: Position Vector transformation (geog2D domain)\nDatum: unknown\n- Ellipsoid: GRS80\n- Prime Meridian: Greenwich\nSource CRS: UTM Zone 12, Northern Hemisphere\n\n\nWe can also illustrate the difference between a geographic and a projected CRS by plotting the zion data in both CRSs (Figure 1.26). Note that we are using the .grid method of matplotlib to draw grid lines on top of the plot.\n# WGS84\nzion.to_crs(4326).plot(edgecolor='black', color='lightgrey').grid()\n# NAD83 / UTM zone 12N\nzion.plot(edgecolor='black', color='lightgrey').grid();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Geographic (WGS84)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Projected (NAD83 / UTM zone 12N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.26: Examples of Coordinate Refrence Systems (CRS) for a vector layer\n\n\n\nWe are going to elaborate on reprojection from one CRS to another (.to_crs in the above code section) in Chapter 6.",

    "section": "1.5 Units",
    "text": "1.5 Units\nAn important feature of CRSs is that they contain information about spatial units. Clearly, it is vital to know whether a house’s measurements are in feet or meters, and the same applies to maps. It is a good cartographic practice to add a scale bar or some other distance indicator onto maps to demonstrate the relationship between distances on the page or screen and distances on the ground. Likewise, it is important for the user to be aware of the units in which the geometry coordinates are, to ensure that subsequent calculations are done in the right context.\nPython spatial data structures in geopandas and rasterio do not natively support the concept of measurement units. The coordinates of a vector layer or a raster are plain numbers, referring to an arbitrary plane. For example, according to the .transform matrix of srtm.tif we can see that the raster resolution is 0.000833 and that its CRS is WGS84 (EPSG: 4326):\n\nsrc.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint16',\n 'nodata': 65535.0,\n 'width': 465,\n 'height': 457,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n        0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)}\n\n\nYou may already know that the units of the WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326) are decimal degrees. However, that information is not accounted for in any numeric calculation, meaning that operations such as buffers can be returned in units of degrees, which is not appropriate in most cases.\nConsequently, you should always be aware of the CRS of your datasets and the units they use. Typically, these are decimal degrees, in a geographic CRS, or \\(m\\), in a projected CRS, although there are exceptions. Geometric calculations such as length, area, or distance, return plain numbers in the same units of the CRS (such as \\(m\\) or \\(m^2\\)). It is up to the user to determine which units the result is given in, and treat the result accordingly. For example, if the area output was in \\(m^2\\) and we need the result in \\(km^2\\), then we need to divide the result by \\(1000^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nBossche, Joris Van den, Kelsey Jordahl, Martin Fleischmann, James McBride, Jacob Wasserman, Matt Richards, Adrian Garcia Badaracco, et al. 2023. “Geopandas/Geopandas: V0.14.0.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8348034.\n\n\nGillies, Sean et al. 2007--. “Shapely: Manipulation and Analysis of Geometric Objects.” toblerity.org. https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely.\n\n\nHarris, Charles R., K.

    "section": "2.1 Introduction",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nAttribute data is non-spatial information associated with geographic (geometry) data. A bus stop provides a simple example: its position would typically be represented by latitude and longitude coordinates (geometry data), in addition to its name. The Elephant & Castle / New Kent Road bus stop in London, for example, has coordinates of -0.098 degrees longitude and 51.495 degrees latitude which can be represented as POINT (-0.098 51.495) using the Simple Feature representation described in Chapter 1. Attributes, such as the name of the bus stop, are the topic of this chapter.\nAnother example of an attribute is the elevation value for a specific grid cell in raster data. Unlike the vector data model, the raster data model stores the coordinate of the grid cell indirectly, meaning the distinction between attribute and spatial information is less clear. Think of a pixel in the 3rd row and the 4th column of a raster matrix: its spatial location is defined by its index in the matrix. In this case, we need to move four cells in the x direction (typically east/right on maps) and three cells in the y direction (typically south/down) from the origin. The raster’s resolution is also important as it defines the distance for each x- and y-step. The resolution and the origin are stored in the raster’s metadata (header), which is a vital component of raster datasets which specifies how pixels relate to geographic coordinates (see also Chapter 3).\nThis chapter teaches how to manipulate geographic objects based on attributes such as the names of bus stops in a vector dataset and elevations of pixels in a raster dataset. For vector data, this means techniques such as subsetting and aggregation (see Section 2.2.1 and Section 2.2.2). Moreover, Section 2.2.3 and Section 2.2.4 demonstrate how to join data onto simple feature objects using a shared ID and how to create new variables, respectively. Each of these operations has a spatial equivalent: [ operator for subsetting a (Geo)DataFrame using a boolean Series, for example, is applicable both for subsetting objects based on their attribute and spatial relations derived using methods such as .intersects; you can also join attributes in two geographic datasets using spatial joins. This is good news: skills developed in this chapter are cross-transferable. Chapter 3 extends the methods presented here to the spatial world.\nAfter a deep dive into various types of vector attribute operations in the next section, raster attribute data operations are covered in Section 2.3.1, which demonstrates extracting cell values from one or more layer (raster subsetting). Section 2.3.2 provides an overview of ‘global’ raster operations which can be used to summarize entire raster datasets.",

    "text": "2.2 Vector attribute manipulation\nAs mentioned in Section 1.2.2, vector layers (GeoDataFrame, from package geopandas) are basically extended tables (DataFrame from package pandas), the difference being that a vector layer has a geometry column. Therefore, all ordinary table-related operations from package pandas are supported for geopandas vector layers as well, as shown below.\n\n2.2.1 Vector attribute subsetting\npandas supports several subsetting interfaces, though the most recommended ones are .loc, which uses pandas indices, and .iloc, which uses (implicit) numpy-style numeric indices.\nIn both cases, the method is followed by square brackets, and two indices, separated by a comma. Each index can be:\n\nA specific value, as in 1\nA list, as in [0,2,4]\nA slice, as in 0:3\n:—indicating “all” indices, as in [:]\n\nAn exception to this guideline is selecting columns using a list, which we do using shorter notation, as in df[['a','b']], instead of df.loc[:, ['a','b']], to select columns 'a' and 'b' from df.\nHere are few examples of subsetting the GeoDataFrame of world countries (Figure 1.2). First, we are subsetting rows by position. In the first example, we are using [0:3,:], meaning “rows 1,2,3, all columns”. Keep in mind that indices in Python start from 0, and slices are inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end; therefore, 0:3 means indices 0, 1, 2, i.e., first three rows in this example. \n\nworld.iloc[0:3, :]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ngdpPercap\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\n8222.253784\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55522,...\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\n2402.099404\nMULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nNaN\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-8.66559 27.656...\n\n\n\n\n3 rows × 11 columns\n\n\n\nSubsetting columns by position requires specifying that we want to keep all of the rows (:) and then the indexes of the columns we want to keep.\n\nworld.iloc[:, 0:3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\ncontinent\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\nOceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\nAfrica\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\nAfrica\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\nEurope\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\nNorth America\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nTo subset rows and columns by position we need to specify both row and column indices, separated by a comma.\n\nworld.iloc[0:3, 0:3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\ncontinent\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\nOceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\nAfrica\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting columns by name is not done with the .iloc method, but instead requires specifying the column names in .loc, or directly in a double square bracket [[ notation.\n\nworld[['name_long', 'geometry']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nFiji\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55522,...\n\n\n1\nTanzania\nMULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n\n\n2\nWestern Sahara\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-8.66559 27.656...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nKosovo\nMULTIPOLYGON (((20.59025 41.855...\n\n\n175\nTrinidad and Tobago\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68 10.76, -...\n\n\n176\nSouth Sudan\nMULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.5091...\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nTo select many successive columns, we can use the : (slice) notation, as in world.loc[:, 'name_long':'pop'], which selects all columns from name_long to pop (inclusive).\n\nworld.loc[:, 'name_long':'pop']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ncontinent\n...\narea_km2\npop\n\n\n\n\n0\nFiji\nOceania\n...\n19289.970733\n885806.0\n\n\n1\nTanzania\nAfrica\n...\n932745.792357\n52234869.0\n\n\n2\nWestern Sahara\nAfrica\n...\n96270.601041\nNaN\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nKosovo\nEurope\n...\n11230.261672\n1821800.0\n\n\n175\nTrinidad and Tobago\nNorth America\n...\n7737.809855\n1354493.0\n\n\n176\nSouth Sudan\nAfrica\n...\n624909.099086\n11530971.0\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 7 columns\n\n\n\nRemoving rows or columns is done using the .drop method.

A classic example of this attribute-based aggregation is calculating the number of people per continent based on country-level data (one row per country). The world dataset contains the necessary ingredients: the columns pop and continent, the population and the grouping variable, respectively. The aim is to find the sum() of country populations for each continent, resulting in a smaller table or vector layer (of continents). Since aggregation is a form of data reduction, it can be a useful early step when working with large datasets.\nAttribute-based aggregation can be achieved using a combination of .groupby and .sum (package pandas), where the former groups the data by the grouping variable(s) and the latter calculates the sum of the specified column(s). The .reset_index methods moves the grouping variable into an ordinary column, rather than an index (the default), which is something we typically want to do.\n\nworld_agg1 = world.groupby('continent')[['pop']].sum().reset_index()\nworld_agg1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinent\npop\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfrica\n1.154947e+09\n\n\n1\nAntarctica\n0.000000e+00\n\n\n2\nAsia\n4.311408e+09\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n5\nOceania\n3.775783e+07\n\n\n6\nSeven seas (open ocean)\n0.000000e+00\n\n\n7\nSouth America\n4.120608e+08\n\n\n\n\n8 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThe result, in this case, is a (non-spatial) table with eight rows, one per unique value in continent, and two columns reporting the name and population of each continent.\nIf we want to include the geometry in the aggregation result, we can use the .dissolve method. That way, in addition to the summed population, we also get the associated geometry per continent, i.e., the union of all countries. Note that we use the by parameter to choose which column(s) are used for grouping, and the aggfunc parameter to choose the aggregation function for non-geometry columns. Again, note that the .reset_index method is used (here, and elsewhere in the book) to turn pandas and geopandas indices, which are automatically created for grouping variables in grouping operations such as .dissolve, “back” into ordinary columns, which are more appropriate in the scope of this book.\n\nworld_agg2 = world[['continent', 'pop', 'geometry']] \\\n    .dissolve(by='continent', aggfunc='sum') \\\n    .reset_index()\nworld_agg2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinent\ngeometry\npop\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfrica\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-11.43878 6.785...\n1.154947e+09\n\n\n1\nAntarctica\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-61.13898 -79.9...\n0.000000e+00\n\n\n2\nAsia\nMULTIPOLYGON (((48.67923 14.003...\n4.311408e+09\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n5\nOceania\nMULTIPOLYGON (((147.91405 -43.2...\n3.775783e+07\n\n\n6\nSeven seas (open ocean)\nPOLYGON ((68.935 -48.625, 68.86...\n0.000000e+00\n\n\n7\nSouth America\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-68.63999 -55.5...\n4.120608e+08\n\n\n\n\n8 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nIn this case, the resulting world_agg2 object is a GeoDataFrame containing 8 features representing the continents of the world that we can plot (Figure 2.1).

Additionally, we can pass custom functions here.\nAs a more complex example, the following code shows how we can calculate the total population, area, and count of countries, per continent. It is done by passing a dictionary to the aggfunc parameter, where the keys are the column names and the values are the aggregation functions. The result is a GeoDataFrame object with 8 rows (one per continent) and 4 columns (one for the continent name and one for each of the three aggregated attributes). The rename method is used to rename the 'name_long' column into 'n', as it now expresses the count of names (i.e., the number of countries) rather than their names.\n\nworld_agg3 = world.dissolve(\n    by='continent', \n    aggfunc={\n        'name_long': 'count',\n        'pop': 'sum',\n        'area_km2': 'sum'\n    }).rename(columns={'name_long': 'n'}).reset_index()\nworld_agg3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinent\ngeometry\nn\npop\narea_km2\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfrica\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-11.43878 6.785...\n51\n1.154947e+09\n2.994620e+07\n\n\n1\nAntarctica\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-61.13898 -79.9...\n1\n0.000000e+00\n1.233596e+07\n\n\n2\nAsia\nMULTIPOLYGON (((48.67923 14.003...\n47\n4.311408e+09\n3.125246e+07\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n5\nOceania\nMULTIPOLYGON (((147.91405 -43.2...\n7\n3.775783e+07\n8.504489e+06\n\n\n6\nSeven seas (open ocean)\nPOLYGON ((68.935 -48.625, 68.86...\n1\n0.000000e+00\n1.160257e+04\n\n\n7\nSouth America\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-68.63999 -55.5...\n13\n4.120608e+08\n1.776259e+07\n\n\n\n\n8 rows × 5 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2 visualizes the three aggregated attributes of our resulting layer world_agg3.\n# Summed population\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.5))\nworld_agg3.plot(column='pop', edgecolor='black', legend=True, ax=ax);\n# Summed area\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.5))\nworld_agg3.plot(column='area_km2', edgecolor='black', legend=True, ax=ax);\n# Count of countries\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.5))\nworld_agg3.plot(column='n', edgecolor='black', legend=True, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Summed population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Summed area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Count of countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Continent’s properties, calculated using spatial aggregation using different functions\n\n\n\nThere are several other table-related operations that are possible, such as creating new columns or sorting the values.

Joins do this by combining tables based on a shared “key” variable. pandas has a function named pd.merge for joining (Geo)DataFrames based on common column(s) that follows conventions used in the database language SQL (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). The pd.merge result can be either a DataFrame or a GeoDataFrame object, depending on the inputs.\nA common type of attribute join on spatial data is to join DataFrames to GeoDataFrames. To achieve this, we use pd.merge with a GeoDataFrame as the first argument and add columns to it from a DataFrame specified as the second argument. In the following example, we combine data on coffee production with the world dataset. The coffee data is in a DataFrame called coffee_data imported from a CSV file of major coffee-producing nations.\n\ncoffee_data = pd.read_csv('data/coffee_data.csv')\ncoffee_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname_long\ncoffee_production_2016\ncoffee_production_2017\n\n\n\n\n0\nAngola\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\nBolivia\n3.0\n4.0\n\n\n2\nBrazil\n3277.0\n2786.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n44\nZambia\n3.0\nNaN\n\n\n45\nZimbabwe\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n46\nOthers\n23.0\n26.0\n\n\n\n\n47 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nIts columns are name_long—country name, and coffee_production_2016 and coffee_production_2017—estimated values for coffee production in units of 60-kg bags per year, for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nA left join, which preserves the first dataset, merges world with coffee_data, based on the common 'name_long' column:\n\nworld_coffee = pd.merge(world, coffee_data, on='name_long', how='left')\nworld_coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ncoffee_production_2016\ncoffee_production_2017\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\n81.0\n66.0\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\nThe result is a GeoDataFrame object identical to the original world object, but with two new variables (coffee_production_2016 and coffee_production_2017) on coffee production. This can be plotted as a map, as illustrated (for coffee_production_2017) in Figure 2.3. Note that, here and in many other examples in later chapters, we are using a technique to plot two layers (all of the world countries outline, and coffee production with symbology) at once, which will be “formally” introduced towards the end of the book in Section 8.2.5.  \n\nbase = world_coffee.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\ncoffee_map = world_coffee.plot(ax=base, column='coffee_production_2017');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: World coffee production, thousand 60-kg bags by country, in 2017 (source: International Coffee Organization).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo work, attribute-based joins need a “key variable” in both datasets (on parameter of pd.merge). In the above example, both world_coffee and world DataFrames contained a column called name_long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, pd.merge uses all columns with matching names. However, it is recommended to explicitly specify the names of the columns to be used for matching, like we did in the last example.\n\n\nIn case where column names are not the same, you can use left_on and right_on to specify the respective columns.\nNote that the result world_coffee has the same number of rows as the original dataset world. Although there are only 47 rows in coffee_data, all 177 country records are kept intact in world_coffee. Rows in the original dataset with no match are assigned np.nan values for the new coffee production variables. This is a characteristic of a left join (specified with how='left') and is what we typically want to do.\nWhat if we only want to keep countries that have a match in the key variable? In that case an inner join can be used, which keeps only rows with a match in both datasets. We can use it with the how='inner' argument.\n\npd.merge(world, coffee_data, on='name_long', how='inner')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ncoffee_production_2016\ncoffee_production_2017\n\n\n\n\n0\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\n81.0\n66.0\n\n\n1\nPG\nPapua New Guinea\n...\n114.0\n74.0\n\n\n2\nID\nIndonesia\n...\n742.0\n360.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n42\nET\nEthiopia\n...\n215.0\n283.0\n\n\n43\nUG\nUganda\n...\n408.0\n443.0\n\n\n44\nRW\nRwanda\n...\n36.0\n42.0\n\n\n\n\n45 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Creating attributes and removing spatial information\nOften, we would like to create a new column based on already existing columns. For example, we want to calculate population density for each country. For this we need to divide a population column, here pop, by an area column, here area_km2. Note that we are working on a copy of world named world2 so that we do not modify the original layer.\n\nworld2 = world.copy()\nworld2['pop_dens'] = world2['pop'] / world2['area_km2']\nworld2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ngeometry\npop_dens\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55522,...\n45.920547\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n56.001184\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-8.66559 27.656...\nNaN\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((20.59025 41.855...\n162.222400\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68 10.76, -...\n175.048628\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.5091...\n18.452237\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 12 columns\n\n\n\nTo paste (i.e., concatenate) together existing columns, we can use the ordinary Python string operator +, as if we are working with individual strings rather than Series. For example, we want to combine the continent and region_un columns into a new column named con_reg, using ':' as a separator. Subsequently, we remove the original columns using .drop:\n\nworld2['con_reg'] = world['continent'] + ':' + world2['region_un']\nworld2 = world2.drop(['continent', 'region_un'], axis=1)\nworld2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\npop_dens\ncon_reg\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\n45.920547\nOceania:Oceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\n56.001184\nAfrica:Africa\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nNaN\nAfrica:Africa\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\n162.222400\nEurope:Europe\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\n175.048628\nNorth America:Americas\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\n18.452237\nAfrica:Africa\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 11 columns\n\n\n\nThe resulting GeoDataFrame object has a new column called con_reg representing the continent and region of each country, e.g., 'South America:Americas' for Argentina and other South America countries. The opposite operation, splitting one column into multiple columns based on a separator string, is done using the .str.split method. As a result we go back to the previous state of two separate continent and region_un columns (only that their position is now last, since they are newly created). The str.split method returns a column of lists by default; to place the strings into separate str columns we use the expand=True argument.\n\nworld2[['continent', 'region_un']] = world2['con_reg'] \\\n    .str.split(':', expand=True)\nworld2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ncontinent\nregion_un\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\nOceania\nOceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\nEurope\nEurope\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\nNorth America\nAmericas\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\nRenaming one or more columns can be done using the .rename method combined with the columns argument, which should be a dictionary of the form old_name:new_name, as shown above (Section 2.2.1). The following command, for example, renames the lengthy name_long column to simply name.\n\nworld2.rename(columns={'name_long': 'name'})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname\n...\ncontinent\nregion_un\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\nOceania\nOceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\nEurope\nEurope\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\nNorth America\nAmericas\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\nTo change all column names at once, we assign a list of the “new” column names into the .columns property. The list must be of the same length as the number of columns (i.e., world.shape[1]). This is illustrated below, which outputs the same world2 object, but with very short names.\n\nnew_names = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'geom', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l']\nworld2.columns = new_names\nworld2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n...\nk\nl\n\n\n\n\n0\nFJ\nFiji\n...\nOceania\nOceania\n\n\n1\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n2\nEH\nWestern Sahara\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n174\nXK\nKosovo\n...\nEurope\nEurope\n\n\n175\nTT\nTrinidad and Tobago\n...\nNorth America\nAmericas\n\n\n176\nSS\nSouth Sudan\n...\nAfrica\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\n177 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\nTo reorder columns, we can pass a modified columns list to the subsetting operator [.

    "text": "2.3 Manipulating raster objects\nRaster cell values can be considered the counterpart of vector attribute values. In this section, we cover operations that deal with raster values in a similar way, namely as a series of numbers. This type of operations include subsetting raster values (Section 2.3.1) and calculating global summaries of raster values (Section 2.3.2).\n\n2.3.1 Raster subsetting\nWhen using rasterio, raster values are accessible through a numpy array, which can be imported with the .read method (as we saw in Section 1.3.1). As shown in Section 1.3.1, reading a single raster layer (or the only layer of a single-band raster, such as here) results in a two-dimensional array:\n\nelev = src_elev.read(1)\nelev\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nThen, we can access any subset of cell values using numpy methods, keeping in mind that dimensions order is (rows, columns). For example, elev[1,2] returns the value at row 2, column 3.\n\nelev[1, 2]\n\n9\n\n\nCell values can be modified by overwriting existing values in conjunction with a subsetting operation, e.g., elev[1,2]=0 to set cell at row 2, column 3 of elev to 0.\n\nelev[1, 2] = 0\nelev\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  0, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nMultiple cells can also be modified in this way, e.g., elev[0,0:3]=0 to set the first three cells in the first row to 0.\n\nelev[0, 0:3] = 0\nelev\n\narray([[ 0,  0,  0,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  0, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nAlternatively, reading more than one layer, or all layers (even if there is just one, such as here) results in a three-dimensional array.\n\nelev3d = src_elev.read()\nelev3d\n\narray([[[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n        [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n        [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n        [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n        [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n        [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can see that the above array is three-dimensional according to the number of brackets [, or check explicitly using .shape or .ndim.\n\n\nIn three-dimensional arrays, we access cell values using three indices, keeping in mind that dimensions order is (layers,rows, columns) For example, to get the same value shown above, at row 2, column 3 (at band 1), we use elev[0,1,2] instead of elev[1,2].\n\nelev3d[0, 1, 2] \n\n9\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Summarizing raster objects\nGlobal summaries of raster values can be calculated by applying numpy summary functions on the array with raster values, e.g., np.mean.\n\nnp.mean(elev)\n\n18.083333333333332\n\n\nNote that “No Data”-safe functions–such as np.nanmean—should be used in case the raster contains “No Data” values which need to be ignored. Before we can demonstrate that, we must convert the array from int to float, as int arrays cannot contain np.nan (due to computer memory limitations).\n\nelev1 = elev.copy()\nelev1 = elev1.astype('float64')\nelev1\n\narray([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  4.,  5.,  6.],\n       [ 7.,  8.,  0., 10., 11., 12.],\n       [13., 14., 15., 16., 17., 18.],\n       [19., 20., 21., 22., 23., 24.],\n       [25., 26., 27., 28., 29., 30.],\n       [31., 32., 33., 34., 35., 36.]])\n\n\nNow we can insert an np.nan value into the array, for example to a cell located in the first row and third column. (Doing so in the original elev array raises an error, because an int array cannot accomodate np.nan, as mentioned above; try it to see for yourself.)\n\nelev1[0, 2] = np.nan\nelev1\n\narray([[ 0.,  0., nan,  4.,  5.,  6.],\n       [ 7.,  8.,  0., 10., 11., 12.],\n       [13., 14., 15., 16., 17., 18.],\n       [19., 20., 21., 22., 23., 24.],\n       [25., 26., 27., 28., 29., 30.],\n       [31., 32., 33., 34., 35., 36.]])\n\n\nWith the np.nan value inplace, the np.mean summary value becomes unknown (np.nan).\n\nnp.mean(elev1)\n\nnan\n\n\nTo get a summary of all non-missing values, we need to use one of the specialized numpy functions that ignore “No Data” values, such as np.nanmean:\n\nnp.nanmean(elev1)\n\n18.6\n\n\nRaster value statistics can be visualized in a variety of ways. One approach is to “flatten” the raster values into a one-dimensional array (using .flatten), then use a graphical function such as plt.hist or plt.boxplot (from matplotlib.pyplot). For example, the following code section shows the distribution of values in elev using a histogram (Figure 2.4).\n\nplt.hist(elev.flatten());\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Distribution of cell values in a continuous raster (elev.tif)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize the distribution of values in a categorical raster, we can calculate the frequencies of unique values, and draw them using a barplot. Let’s demonstrate using the grain.tif small categorical raster.\n\ngrain = src_grain.read(1)\ngrain\n\narray([[1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2],\n       [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1],\n       [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\n       [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n       [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n       [2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nTo calculate the frequency of unique values in an array, we use the np.unique with the return_counts=True option. The result is a tuple with two corresponding arrays: the unique values, and their counts.\n\nfreq = np.unique(grain, return_counts=True)\nfreq\n\n(array([0, 1, 2], dtype=uint8), array([10, 13, 13]))\n\n\nThese two arrays can be passed to the plt.bar function to draw a barplot, as shown in Figure 2.5.\n\nplt.bar(*freq);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Distribution of cell values in categorical raster (grain.tif)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrolemund, Garrett, and Hadley Wickham. 2016.

    "section": "3.1 Introduction",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nSpatial operations, including spatial joins between vector datasets and local and focal operations on raster datasets, are a vital part of geocomputation. This chapter shows how spatial objects can be modified in a multitude of ways based on their location and shape. Many spatial operations have a non-spatial (attribute) equivalent, so concepts such as subsetting and joining datasets demonstrated in the previous chapter are applicable here. This is especially true for vector operations: Section 2.2 on vector attribute manipulation provides the basis for understanding its spatial counterpart, namely spatial subsetting (covered in Section 3.2.1). Spatial joining (Section 3.2.3) and aggregation (Section 3.2.5) also have non-spatial counterparts, covered in the previous chapter.\nSpatial operations differ from non-spatial operations in a number of ways, however. Spatial joins, for example, can be done in a number of ways—including matching entities that intersect with or are within a certain distance of the target dataset—while the attribution joins discussed in Section 2.2.3 in the previous chapter can only be done in one way. Different types of spatial relationship between objects, including intersects and disjoint, are described in Section 3.2.2. Another unique aspect of spatial objects is distance: all spatial objects are related through space, and distance calculations can be used to explore the strength of this relationship, as described in the context of vector data in Section 3.2.7.\nSpatial operations on raster objects include subsetting—covered in Section 3.3.1—and merging several raster ‘tiles’ into a single object, as demonstrated in Section 3.3.8. Map algebra covers a range of operations that modify raster cell values, with or without reference to surrounding cell values. The concept of map algebra, vital for many applications, is introduced in Section 3.3.2; local, focal, and zonal map algebra operations are covered in sections Section 3.3.3, Section 3.3.4, and Section 3.3.5, respectively. Global map algebra operations, which generate summary statistics representing an entire raster dataset, and distance calculations on rasters, are discussed in Section Section 3.3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that spatial operations that use two spatial objects rely on both objects having the same coordinate reference system, a topic that was introduced in Section 1.4 and which will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6.",

Section 3.3 then presents spatial operations on raster datasets, using the rasterio and scipy packages.\n\n3.2.1 Spatial subsetting\n\n\nSpatial subsetting is the process of taking a spatial object and returning a new object containing only features that relate in space to another object. Analogous to attribute subsetting (covered in Section 2.2.1), subsets of GeoDataFrames can be created with square bracket ([) operator using the syntax x[y], where x is an GeoDataFrame from which a subset of rows/features will be returned, and y is a boolean Series. The difference is, that, in spatial subsetting y is created based on another geometry and using one of the binary geometry relation methods, such as .intersects (see Section 3.2.2), rather based on comparison based on ordinary columns.\nTo demonstrate spatial subsetting, we will use the nz and nz_height layers, which contain geographic data on the 16 main regions and 101 highest points in New Zealand, respectively (Figure 3.1 (a)), in a projected coordinate system. The following expression creates a new object, canterbury, representing only one region — Canterbury.\n\ncanterbury = nz[nz['Name'] == 'Canterbury']\ncanterbury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nIsland\n...\nSex_ratio\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n10\nCanterbury\nSouth\n...\n0.975327\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1686901.914 535...\n\n\n\n\n1 rows × 7 columns\n\n\n\nThen, we use the .intersects method to evaluate, for each of the nz_height points, whether they intersect with Canterbury. The result canterbury_height is a boolean Series with the “answers”.\n\nsel = nz_height.intersects(canterbury.geometry.iloc[0])\nsel\n\n0      False\n1      False\n2      False\n       ...  \n98     False\n99     False\n100    False\nLength: 101, dtype: bool\n\n\nFinally, we can subset nz_height using the obtained Series, resulting in the subset canterbury_height with only those points that intersect with Canterbury.\n\ncanterbury_height = nz_height[sel]\ncanterbury_height\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt50_fid\nelevation\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n4\n2362630\n2749\nPOINT (1378169.6 5158491.453)\n\n\n5\n2362814\n2822\nPOINT (1389460.041 5168749.086)\n\n\n6\n2362817\n2778\nPOINT (1390166.225 5169466.158)\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n92\n2380298\n2877\nPOINT (1652788.127 5348984.469)\n\n\n93\n2380300\n2711\nPOINT (1654213.379 5349962.973)\n\n\n94\n2380308\n2885\nPOINT (1654898.622 5350462.779)\n\n\n\n\n70 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 compares the original nz_height layer (left) with the subset canterbury_height (right).  \n# Original\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nnz_height.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n# Subset (intersects)\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\ncanterbury.plot(ax=base, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\ncanterbury_height.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original points (red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Spatial subset based on intersection (red), geometry used for subsetting (Canterbury) (grey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Spatial subsetting of points by intersection with polygon\n\n\n\nLike in attribute subsetting (Section 2.2.1), we are using a boolean series (sel), of the same length as the number of rows in the filtered table (nz_height), created based on a condition applied on itself. The difference is that the condition is not a comparison of attribute values, but an evaluation of a spatial relation. Namely, we evaluate whether each geometry of nz_height intersects with the canterbury geometry, using the .intersects method.\nVarious topological relations can be used for spatial subsetting which determine the type of spatial relationship that features in the target object must have with the subsetting object to be selected. These include touches, crosses, or within, as we will see shortly in Section 3.2.2. Intersects (.intersects), which we used in the last example, is the the most commonly used method. This is a ‘catch all’ topological relation, that will return features in the target that touch, cross or are within the source ‘subsetting’ object. As an example of another method, we can use .disjoint to obtain all points that do not intersect with Canterbury.\n\nsel = nz_height.disjoint(canterbury.geometry.iloc[0])\ncanterbury_height2 = nz_height[sel]\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 3.2, which compares the original nz_height layer (left) with the subset canterbury_height2 (right).\n# Original\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nnz_height.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n# Subset (disjoint)\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\ncanterbury.plot(ax=base, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\ncanterbury_height2.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original points (red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Spatial subset based on disjoint (red), geometry used for subsetting (Canterbury) (grey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Spatial subsetting of points disjoint from a polygon\n\n\n\nIn case we need to subset according to several geometries at once, e.g., find out which points intersect with both Canterbury and Southland, we can dissolve the filtering subset, using .union_all, before applying the .intersects (or any other) operator. For example, here is how we can subset the nz_height points which intersect with Canterbury or Southland. (Note that we are also using the .isin method, as demonstrated in the end of Section 2.2.1.)\n\ncanterbury_southland = nz[nz['Name'].isin(['Canterbury', 'Southland'])]\nsel = nz_height.intersects(canterbury_southland.union_all())\ncanterbury_southland_height = nz_height[sel]\ncanterbury_southland_height\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt50_fid\nelevation\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n2353944\n2723\nPOINT (1204142.603 5049971.287)\n\n\n4\n2362630\n2749\nPOINT (1378169.6 5158491.453)\n\n\n5\n2362814\n2822\nPOINT (1389460.041 5168749.086)\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n92\n2380298\n2877\nPOINT (1652788.127 5348984.469)\n\n\n93\n2380300\n2711\nPOINT (1654213.379 5349962.973)\n\n\n94\n2380308\n2885\nPOINT (1654898.622 5350462.779)\n\n\n\n\n71 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 shows the results of the spatial subsetting of nz_height points by intersection with Canterbury and Southland.\n# Original\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nnz_height.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n# Subset by intersection with two polygons\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\ncanterbury_southland.plot(ax=base, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\ncanterbury_southland_height.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original points (red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Spatial subset based on intersection (red), geometry used for subsetting (Canterbury and Southland) (grey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Spatial subsetting of points by intersection with more that one polygon\n\n\n\nThe next section further explores different types of spatial relation, also known as binary predicates (of which .intersects and .disjoint are two examples), that can be used to identify whether or not two features are spatially related.\n\n\n3.2.2 Topological relations\nTopological relations describe the spatial relationships between objects. “Binary topological relationships”, to give them their full name, are logical statements (in that the answer can only be True or False) about the spatial relationships between two objects defined by ordered sets of points (typically forming points, lines and polygons) in two or more dimensions (Egenhofer and Herring 1990). That may sound rather abstract and, indeed, the definition and classification of topological relations is based on mathematical foundations first published in book form in 1966 (Spanier 1995), with the field of algebraic topology continuing into the 21st century (Dieck 2008).\nDespite their mathematical origins, topological relations can be understood intuitively with reference to visualizations of commonly used functions that test for common types of spatial relationships. Figure 3.4 shows a variety of geometry pairs and their associated relations. The third and fourth pairs in Figure 3.4 (from left to right and then down) demonstrate that, for some relations, order is important: while the relations equals, intersects, crosses, touches and overlaps are symmetrical, meaning that if x.relation(y) is true, y.relation(x) will also be true, relations in which the order of the geometries are important such as contains and within are not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that each geometry pair has a “DE-9IM” string such as FF2F11212. DE-9IM strings describe the dimensionality (0=points, 1=lines, 2=polygons) of the pairwise intersections of the interior, boundary, and exterior, of two geometries (i.e., nine values of 0/1/2 encoded into a string). This is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this book, which can be useful to understand the difference between relation types, or define custom types of relations. See the DE-9IM strings section in Geocomputation with R (Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow 2019). Also note that the shapely package contains the .relate and .relate_pattern methods, to derive and to test for DE-9IM patterns, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Topological relations between vector geometries, inspired by Figures 1 and 2 in (Egenhofer and Herring 1990). The relations for which the x.relation(y) is true are printed for each geometry pair, with x represented in pink and y represented in blue. The nature of the spatial relationship for each pair is described by the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model string.\n\n\n\nIn shapely, methods testing for different types of topological relations are known as “relationships”. geopandas provides their wrappers (with the same method name) which can be applied on multiple geometries at once (such as .intersects and .disjoint applied on all points in nz_height, see Section 3.2.1). To see how topological relations work in practice, let’s create a simple reproducible example, building on the relations illustrated in Figure 3.4 and consolidating knowledge of how vector geometries are represented from a previous chapter (Section 1.2.3 and Section 1.2.5).\n\npoints = gpd.GeoSeries([\n  shapely.Point(0.2,0.1), \n  shapely.Point(0.7,0.2), \n  shapely.Point(0.4,0.8)\n])\nline = gpd.GeoSeries([\n  shapely.LineString([(0.4,0.2), (1,0.5)])\n])\npoly = gpd.GeoSeries([\n  shapely.Polygon([(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0.5), (0,0)])\n])\n\nThe sample dataset which we created is composed of three is GeoSeries: named points, line, and poly, which are visualized in Figure 3.5. The last expression is a for loop used to add text labels (0, 1, and 2) to identify the points; we are going to explain the concepts of text annotations with geopandas .plot in Section 8.2.4.\n\nbase = poly.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='red')\nline.plot(ax=base, color='black', linewidth=7)\npoints.plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='black')\nfor i in enumerate(points):\n    base.annotate(\n        i[0], xy=(i[1].x, i[1].y), \n        xytext=(3, 3), textcoords='offset points', weight='bold'\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Points (points), line (line) and polygon (poly) objects used to illustrate topological relations\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple query is: which of the points in points intersect in some way with polygon poly? The question can be answered by visual inspection (points 0 and 2 are touching and are within the polygon, respectively). Alternatively, we can get the solution with the .intersects method, which reports whether or not each geometry in a GeoSeries (points) intersects with a single shapely geometry (poly.iloc[0]).\n\npoints.intersects(poly.iloc[0])\n\n0     True\n1    False\n2     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThe result shown above is a boolean Series. Its contents should match our intuition: positive (True) results are returned for the points 0 and 2, and a negative result (False) for point 1. Each value in this Series represents a feature in the first input (points).\nAll earlier examples in this chapter demonstrate the “many-to-one” mode of .intersects and analogous methods, where the relation is evaluated between each of several geometries in a GeoSeries/GeoDataFrame, and an individual shapely geometry. A second mode of those methods (not demonstrated here) is when both inputs are GeoSeries/GeoDataFrame objects. In such case, a “pairwise” evaluation takes place between geometries aligned by index (align=True, the default) or by position (align=False). For example, the expression nz.intersects(nz) returns a Series of 16 True values, indicating (unsurprisingly) that each geometry in nz intersects with itself.\nA third mode is when we are interested in a “many-to-many” evaluation, i.e., obtaining a matrix of all pairwise combinations of geometries from two GeoSeries objects. At the time of writing, there is no built-in method to do this in geopandas. However, the .apply method (package pandas) can be used to repeat a “many-to-one” evaluation over all geometries in the second layer, resulting in a matrix of pairwise results. We will create another GeoSeries with two polygons, named poly2, to demonstrate this.\n\npoly2 = gpd.GeoSeries([\n  shapely.Polygon([(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0.5), (0,0)]),\n  shapely.Polygon([(0,0), (1,0.5), (1,0), (0,0)])\n])\n\nOur two input objects, points and poly2, are illustrated in Figure 3.6.\n\nbase = poly2.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='red')\npoints.plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='black')\nfor i in enumerate(points):\n    base.annotate(\n        i[0], xy=(i[1].x, i[1].y), \n        xytext=(3, 3), textcoords='offset points', weight='bold'\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Inputs for demonstrating the evaluation of all pairwise intersection relations between three points (points) and two polygons (poly2)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use .apply to get the intersection relations matrix. The result is a DataFrame, where each row represents a points geometry and each column represents a poly2 geometry. We can see that the point 0 intersects with both polygons, while points 1 and 2 intersect with one of the polygons each.\n\npoints.apply(lambda x: poly2.intersects(x))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n0\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n1\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe .apply method (package pandas) is used to apply a function along one of the axes of a DataFrame (or GeoDataFrame). That is, we can apply a function on all rows (axis=1) or all columns (axis=0, the default). When the function being applied returns a single value, the output of .apply is a Series (e.g., .apply(len) returns the lengths of all columns, because len returns a single value). When the function returns a Series, then .apply returns a DataFrame (such as in the above example.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince the above result, like any pairwise matrix, (1) is composed of values of the same type, and (2) has no contrasting role for rows and columns, is may be more convenient to use a plain numpy array to work with it. In such case, we can use the .to_numpy method to go from DataFrame to ndarray.\n\npoints.apply(lambda x: poly2.intersects(x)).to_numpy()\n\narray([[ True,  True],\n       [False,  True],\n       [ True, False]])\n\n\n\n\nThe .intersects method returns True even in cases where the features just touch: intersects is a ‘catch-all’ topological operation which identifies many types of spatial relation, as illustrated in Figure 3.4. More restrictive questions include which points lie within the polygon, and which features are on or contain a shared boundary with it? The first question can be answered with .within, and the second with .touches.\n\npoints.within(poly.iloc[0])\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\n\npoints.touches(poly.iloc[0])\n\n0     True\n1    False\n2    False\ndtype: bool\n\n\nNote that although the point 0 touches the boundary polygon, it is not within it; point 2 is within the polygon but does not touch any part of its border. The opposite of .intersects is .disjoint, which returns only objects that do not spatially relate in any way to the selecting object.\n\npoints.disjoint(poly.iloc[0])\n\n0    False\n1     True\n2    False\ndtype: bool\n\n\nAnother useful type of relation is “within distance”, where we detect features that intersect with the target buffered by particular distance. Buffer distance determines how close target objects need to be before they are selected. This can be done by literally buffering (Section 1.2.5) the target geometry, and evaluating intersection (.intersects). Another way is to calculate the distances using the .distance method, and then evaluate whether they are within a threshold distance.\n\npoints.distance(poly.iloc[0]) &lt; 0.2\n\n0    True\n1    True\n2    True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nNote that although point 1 is more than 0.2 units of distance from the nearest vertex of poly, it is still selected when the distance is set to 0.2. This is because distance is measured to the nearest edge, in this case the part of the the polygon that lies directly above point 2 in Figure Figure 3.4. We can verify that the actual distance between point 1 and the polygon is 0.13, as follows.\n\npoints.iloc[1].distance(poly.iloc[0])\n\n0.13416407864998736\n\n\nThis is also a good opportunity to repeat that all distance-related calculations in geopandas (and shapely) assume planar geometry, and only take into account the coordinate values. It is up to the user to make sure that all input layers are in the same projected CRS, so that this type of calculations make sense (see Section 6.4 and Section 6.5).\n\n\n3.2.3 Spatial joining\nJoining two non-spatial datasets uses a shared ‘key’ variable, as described in Section 2.2.3. Spatial data joining applies the same concept, but instead relies on spatial relations, described in the previous section. As with attribute data, joining adds new columns to the target object (the argument x in joining functions), from a source object (y).\nThe following example illustrates the process: imagine you have ten points randomly distributed across the Earth’s surface and you ask, for the points that are on land, which countries are they in? Implementing this idea in a reproducible example will build your geographic data handling skills and show how spatial joins work. The starting point is to create points that are randomly scattered over the planar surface that represents Earth’s geographic coordinates, in decimal degrees (Figure 3.7 (a)).\n\nnp.random.seed(11)       ## set seed for reproducibility\nbb = world.total_bounds  ## the world's bounds\nx = np.random.uniform(low=bb[0], high=bb[2], size=10)\ny = np.random.uniform(low=bb[1], high=bb[3], size=10)\nrandom_points = gpd.points_from_xy(x, y, crs=4326)\nrandom_points = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': random_points})\nrandom_points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-115.10291 36.78178)\n\n\n1\nPOINT (-172.98891 -71.02938)\n\n\n2\nPOINT (-13.24134 65.23272)\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n7\nPOINT (-4.54623 -69.64082)\n\n\n8\nPOINT (159.05039 -34.99599)\n\n\n9\nPOINT (126.28622 -62.49509)\n\n\n\n\n10 rows × 1 columns\n\n\n\nThe scenario illustrated in Figure 3.7 shows that the random_points object (top left) lacks attribute data, while the world (top right) has attributes, including country names shown for a sample of countries in the legend. Before creating the joined dataset, we use spatial subsetting to create world_random, which contains only countries that contain random points, to verify the number of country names returned in the joined dataset should be four (see the top right panel of Figure 3.7 (b)).\n\nworld_random = world[world.intersects(random_points.union_all())]\nworld_random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ngdpPercap\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n4\nUS\nUnited States\n...\n51921.984639\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-171.73166 63.7...\n\n\n18\nRU\nRussian Federation\n...\n25284.586202\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 64.97971, ...\n\n\n52\nML\nMali\n...\n1865.160622\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-11.51394 12.44...\n\n\n159\nAQ\nAntarctica\n...\nNaN\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -89.9, 179...\n\n\n\n\n4 rows × 11 columns\n\n\n\nSpatial joins are implemented with x.sjoin(y), as illustrated in the code chunk below.

The datasets cycle_hire and cycle_hire_osm provide a good example. Plotting them reveals that they are often closely related but they do not seem to touch, as shown in Figure 3.8.\n\nbase = cycle_hire.plot(edgecolor='blue', color='none')\ncycle_hire_osm.plot(ax=base, edgecolor='red', color='none');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The spatial distribution of cycle hire points in London based on official data (blue) and OpenStreetMap data (red).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can check if any of the points are the same by creating a pairwise boolean matrix of .intersects relations, then evaluating whether any of the values in it is True. Note that the .to_numpy method is applied to go from a DataFrame to an ndarray, for which .any gives a global rather than a row-wise summary.

Statistical aggregating functions, such as mean, average, or sum, summarize multiple values of a variable, and return a single value per grouping variable. Section 2.2.2 demonstrated how the .groupby method, combined with summary functions such as .sum, condense data based on attribute variables. This section shows how grouping by spatial objects can be achieved using spatial joins combined with non-spatial aggregation.\nReturning to the example of New Zealand, imagine you want to find out the average height of nz_height points in each region. It is the geometry of the source (nz) that defines how values in the target object (nz_height) are grouped. This can be done in three steps:\n\nFiguring out which nz region each nz_height point falls in—using gpd.sjoin\nSummarizing the average elevation per region—using .groupby and .mean\nJoining the result back to nz—using pd.merge\n\nFirst, we ‘attach’ the region classification of each point, using spatial join (Section 3.2.3). Note that we are using the minimal set of columns required: the geometries (for the spatial join to work), the point elevation (to later calculate an average), and the region name (to use as key when joining the results back to nz). The result tells us which nz region each elevation point falls in.\n\nnz_height2 = gpd.sjoin(\n  nz_height[['elevation', 'geometry']], \n  nz[['Name', 'geometry']], \n  how='left'\n)\nnz_height2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelevation\ngeometry\nindex_right\nName\n\n\n\n\n0\n2723\nPOINT (1204142.603 5049971.287)\n12\nSouthland\n\n\n1\n2820\nPOINT (1234725.325 5048309.302)\n11\nOtago\n\n\n2\n2830\nPOINT (1235914.511 5048745.117)\n11\nOtago\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n98\n2751\nPOINT (1820659.873 5649488.235)\n2\nWaikato\n\n\n99\n2720\nPOINT (1822262.592 5650428.656)\n2\nWaikato\n\n\n100\n2732\nPOINT (1822492.184 5650492.304)\n2\nWaikato\n\n\n\n\n101 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\nSecond, we calculate the average elevation, using ordinary (non-spatial) aggregation (Section 2.2.2). This result tells us the average elevation of all nz_height points located within each nz region.\n\nnz_height2 = nz_height2.groupby('Name')[['elevation']].mean().reset_index()\nnz_height2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nelevation\n\n\n\n\n0\nCanterbury\n2994.600000\n\n\n1\nManawatu-Wanganui\n2777.000000\n\n\n2\nMarlborough\n2720.000000\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n4\nSouthland\n2723.000000\n\n\n5\nWaikato\n2734.333333\n\n\n6\nWest Coast\n2889.454545\n\n\n\n\n7 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThe third and final step is joining the averages back to the nz layer.\n\nnz2 = pd.merge(nz[['Name', 'geometry']], nz_height2, on='Name', how='left')\nnz2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\ngeometry\nelevation\n\n\n\n\n0\nNorthland\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1745493.196 600...\nNaN\n\n\n1\nAuckland\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1803822.103 590...\nNaN\n\n\n2\nWaikato\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1860345.005 585...\n2734.333333\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n13\nTasman\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1616642.877 542...\nNaN\n\n\n14\nNelson\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1624866.278 541...\nNaN\n\n\n15\nMarlborough\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1686901.914 535...\n2720.000000\n\n\n\n\n16 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nWe now have create the nz2 layer, which gives the average nz_height elevation value per polygon. The result is shown in Figure 3.10. Note that the missing_kwds part determines the style of geometries where the symbology attribute (elevation) is missing, because there were no nz_height points overlapping with them. The default is to omit them, which is usually not what we want, but with {'color':'grey','edgecolor':'black'}, those polygons are shown with black outline and grey fill.\n\nnz2.plot(\n  column='elevation', \n  legend=True,\n  cmap='Blues', edgecolor='black',\n  missing_kwds={'color': 'grey', 'edgecolor': 'black'}\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Average height of the top 101 high points across the regions of New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Joining incongruent layers\nSpatial congruence is an important concept related to spatial aggregation. An aggregating object (which we will refer to as y) is congruent with the target object (x) if the two objects have shared borders. Often this is the case for administrative boundary data, whereby larger units—such as Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) in the UK, or districts in many other European countries—are composed of many smaller units.\nIncongruent aggregating objects, by contrast, do not share common borders with the target (Qiu, Zhang, and Zhou 2012). This is problematic for spatial aggregation (and other spatial operations) illustrated in Figure 3.11: aggregating the centroid of each sub-zone will not return accurate results. Areal interpolation overcomes this issue by transferring values from one set of areal units to another, using a range of algorithms including simple area weighted approaches and more sophisticated approaches such as ‘pycnophylactic’ methods (Tobler 1979).\nTo demonstrate joining incongruent layers, we will create a “synthetic” layer comprising a regular grid of rectangles of size \\(100\\times100\\) \\(km\\), covering the extent of the nz layer. This recipe can be used to create a regular grid covering any given layer (other than nz), at the specified resolution (res). Most of the functions have been explained in previous chapters; we leave it as an exerise for the reader to explore how the code works.\n\n# Settings: grid extent, resolution, and CRS\nbounds = nz.total_bounds\ncrs = nz.crs\nres = 100000\n# Calculating grid dimensions\nxmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bounds\ncols = list(range(int(np.floor(xmin)), int(np.ceil(xmax+res)), res))\nrows = list(range(int(np.floor(ymin)), int(np.ceil(ymax+res)), res))\nrows.reverse()\n# For each cell, create 'shapely' polygon (rectangle)\npolygons = []\nfor x in cols:\n    for y in rows:\n        polygons.append(\n            shapely.Polygon([(x,y), (x+res, y), (x+res, y-res), (x, y-res)])\n        )\n# To 'GeoDataFrame'\ngrid = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': polygons}, crs=crs)\n# Remove rows/columns beyond the extent\nsel = grid.intersects(shapely.box(*bounds))\ngrid = grid[sel]\n# Add consecultive IDs\ngrid['id'] = grid.index\ngrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\nid\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOLYGON ((1090143 6248536, 1190...\n0\n\n\n1\nPOLYGON ((1090143 6148536, 1190...\n1\n\n\n2\nPOLYGON ((1090143 6048536, 1190...\n2\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n156\nPOLYGON ((1990143 5048536, 2090...\n156\n\n\n157\nPOLYGON ((1990143 4948536, 2090...\n157\n\n\n158\nPOLYGON ((1990143 4848536, 2090...\n158\n\n\n\n\n150 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11 shows the newly created grid layer, along with the nz layer.\n\nbase = grid.plot(color='none', edgecolor='grey')\nnz.plot(\n    ax=base, \n    column='Population', \n    edgecolor='black', \n    legend=True, \n    cmap='viridis_r'\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: The nz layer, with population size in each region, overlaid with a regular grid of rectangles\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal, now, is to “transfer” the 'Population' attribute (Figure 3.11) to the rectangular grid polygons, which is an example of a join between incongruent layers. To do that, we basically need to calculate–for each grid cell—the weighted sum of the population in nz polygons coinciding with that cell. The weights in the weighted sum calculation are the ratios between the area of the coinciding “part” out of the entire nz polygon. That is, we (inevitably) assume that the population in each nz polygon is equally distributed across space, therefore a partial nz polygon contains the respective partial population size.\nWe start by calculating the entire area of each nz polygon, as follows, using the .area method (Section 1.2.7).\n\nnz['area'] = nz.area\nnz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nIsland\n...\ngeometry\narea\n\n\n\n\n0\nNorthland\nNorth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1745493.196 600...\n1.289058e+10\n\n\n1\nAuckland\nNorth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1803822.103 590...\n4.911565e+09\n\n\n2\nWaikato\nNorth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1860345.005 585...\n2.458882e+10\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n13\nTasman\nSouth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1616642.877 542...\n9.594918e+09\n\n\n14\nNelson\nSouth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1624866.278 541...\n4.080754e+08\n\n\n15\nMarlborough\nSouth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1686901.914 535...\n1.046485e+10\n\n\n\n\n16 rows × 8 columns\n\n\n\nNext, we use the .overlay method to calculate the pairwise intersections between nz and grid.

In extensive interpolation, we assume that the variable of interest represents counts (such as, here, inhabitants) uniformly distributed across space. In such case, each “part” of a given polygon captures the respective proportion of counts (such as, half of a region with \\(N\\) inhabitants contains \\(N/2\\) ihnabitants). Accordingly, summing the parts gives the total count of the total area.\nAn area-weighted interpolation of a spatially intensive variable (e.g., population density) is almost identical, except that we would have to calculate the weighted .mean rather than .sum, to preserve the average rather than the sum. In intensive interpolation, we assume that the variable of interest represents counts per unit area, i.e., density. Since density is (assumed to be) uniform, any “part” of a given polygon has exactly the same density as that of the whole polygon. Density values are therefore computed as weighted averages, rather than sums, of the parts. Also see the “Area-weighted interpolation” section in Pebesma and Bivand (2023).\n\n\n3.2.7 Distance relations\nWhile topological relations are binary—a feature either intersects with another or does not—distance relations are continuous. The distance between two objects is calculated with the .distance method. The method is applied on a GeoSeries (or a GeoDataFrame), with the argument being an individual shapely geometry. The result is a Series of pairwise distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ngeopandas uses similar syntax and mode of operation for many of its methods and functions, including:\n\nNumeric calculations, such as .distance (this section), returning numeric values\nTopological evaluations methods, such as .intersects or .disjoint (Section 3.2.2), returning boolean values\nGeometry generating-methods, such as .intersection (Section 4.2.5), returning geometries\n\nIn all cases, the input is a GeoSeries and (or a GeoDataFrame) and a shapely geometry, and the output is a Series or GeoSeries of results, contrasting each geometry from the GeoSeries with the shapely geometry. The examples in this book demonstrate this, so called “many-to-one”, mode of the functions.\nAll of the above-mentioned methods also have a pairwise mode, perhaps less useful and not used in the book, where we evaluate relations between pairs of geometries in two GeoSeries, aligned either by index or by position.\n\n\nTo illustrate the .distance method, let’s take the three highest point in New Zealand with .sort_values and .iloc.\n\nnz_highest = nz_height.sort_values(by='elevation', ascending=False).iloc[:3, :]\nnz_highest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt50_fid\nelevation\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n64\n2372236\n3724\nPOINT (1369317.63 5169132.284)\n\n\n63\n2372235\n3717\nPOINT (1369512.866 5168235.616)\n\n\n67\n2372252\n3688\nPOINT (1369381.942 5168761.875)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we need the geographic centroid of the Canterbury region (canterbury, created in Section 3.2.1).\n\ncanterbury_centroid = canterbury.centroid.iloc[0]\n\nNow we are able to apply .distance to calculate the distances from each of the three elevation points to the centroid of the Canterbury region.\n\nnz_highest.distance(canterbury_centroid)\n\n64    115539.995747\n63    115390.248038\n67    115493.594066\ndtype: float64\n\n\nTo obtain a distance matrix, i.e., a pairwise set of distances between all combinations of features in objects x and y, we need to use the .apply method (analogous to the way we created the .intersects boolean matrix in Section 3.2.2). To illustrate this, let’s now take two regions in nz, Otago and Canterbury, represented by the object co.\n\nsel = nz['Name'].str.contains('Canter|Otag')\nco = nz[sel]\nco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nIsland\n...\ngeometry\narea\n\n\n\n\n10\nCanterbury\nSouth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1686901.914 535...\n4.532656e+10\n\n\n11\nOtago\nSouth\n...\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1335204.789 512...\n3.190356e+10\n\n\n\n\n2 rows × 8 columns\n\n\n\nThe distance matrix (technically speaking, a DataFrame) d between each of the first three elevation points, and the two regions, is then obtained as follows. In plain language, we take the geometry from each each row in nz_height.iloc[:3,:], and apply the .distance method on co with its rows as the argument.\n\nd = nz_height.iloc[:3, :].apply(lambda x: co.distance(x.geometry), axis=1)\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n11\n\n\n\n\n0\n123537.158269\n15497.717252\n\n\n1\n94282.773074\n0.000000\n\n\n2\n93018.560814\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the distance between the second and third features in nz_height and the second feature in co is zero.

    "text": "3.3 Spatial operations on raster data\nThis section builds on Section 2.3, which highlights various basic methods for manipulating raster datasets, to demonstrate more advanced and explicitly spatial raster operations, and uses the elev.tif and grain.tif rasters manually created in Section 1.3.2.\n\n3.3.1 Spatial subsetting\nThe previous chapter (and especially Section 2.3) demonstrated how to retrieve values associated with specific row and column combinations from a raster. Raster values can also be extracted by location (coordinates) and other spatial objects. To use coordinates for subsetting, we can use the .sample method of a rasterio file connection object, combined with a list of coordinate tuples. The methods is demonstrated below to find the value of the cell that covers a point located at coordinates of (0.1,0.1) in elev. The returned object is a generator. The rationale for returning a generator, rather than a list, is memory efficiency. The number of sampled points may be huge, in which case we would want to “generate” the values one at a time rather than all at once.\n\nsrc_elev.sample([(0.1, 0.1)])\n\n&lt;generator object sample_gen at 0x7f794166e880&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe technical terms iterable, iterator, and generator in Python may be confusing, so here is a short summary, ordered from most general to most specific:\n\nAn iterable is any object that we can iterate on, such as using a for loop. For example, a list is iterable.\nAn iterator is an object that represents a stream of data, which we can go over, each time getting the next element using next. Iterators are also iterable, meaning that you can over them in a loop, but they are stateful (e.g., they remember which item was obtained using next), meaning that you can go over them just once.\nA generator is a function that returns an iterator. For example, the .sample method in the above example is a generator. The rasterio package makes use of generators in some of its functions, as we will see later on (Section 5.5.1).\n\n\n\nIn case we nevertheless want all values at once, such as when the number of points is small, we can force the generatrion of all values from a generator at once, using list. Since there was just one point, the result is one extracted value, in this case 16.\n\nlist(src_elev.sample([(0.1, 0.1)]))\n\n[array([16], dtype=uint8)]\n\n\nWe can use the same technique to extract the values of multiple points at once. For example, here we extract the raster values at two points, (0.1,0.1) and (1.1,1.1). The resulting values are 16 and 6.\n\nlist(src_elev.sample([(0.1, 0.1), (1.1, 1.1)]))\n\n[array([16], dtype=uint8), array([6], dtype=uint8)]\n\n\nThe location of the two sample points on top of the elev.tif raster is illustrated in Figure 3.16.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_elev, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries([shapely.Point(0.1, 0.1)]) \\\n    .plot(color='black', edgecolor='white', markersize=50, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries([shapely.Point(1.1, 1.1)]) \\\n    .plot(color='black', edgecolor='white', markersize=50, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.16: The elev.tif raster, and two points where we extract its values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe elaborate on the plotting technique used to display the points and the raster in Section 8.2.5. We will also introduce a more user-friendly and general method to extract raster values to points, using the rasterstats package, in Section 5.3.1.\n\n\nAnother common use case of spatial subsetting is using a boolean mask, based on another raster with the same extent and resolution, or the original one, as illustrated in Figure 3.17. To do that, we “erase” the values in the array of one raster, according to another corresponding “mask” raster. For example, let’s read (Section 1.3.1) the elev.tif raster values into an array named elev (Figure 3.17 (a)).\n\nelev = src_elev.read(1)\nelev\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nand create a corresponding random boolean mask named mask (Figure 3.17 (b)), of the same shape as elev.tif with values randomly assigned to True and False.\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\nmask = np.random.choice([True, False], src_elev.shape)\nmask\n\narray([[False, False,  True,  True, False, False],\n       [False, False, False,  True,  True, False],\n       [ True, False, False,  True,  True, False],\n       [ True,  True,  True, False,  True,  True],\n       [False,  True,  True,  True, False,  True],\n       [ True,  True, False, False, False, False]])\n\n\nNext, suppose that we want to keep only those values of elev which are False in mask (i.e., they are not masked). In other words, we want to mask elev with mask. The result will be stored in a copy named masked_elev (Figure 3.17 (c)). In the case of elev.tif, to be able to store np.nan in the array of values, we also need to convert it to float (see Section 2.3.2). Afterwards, masking is a matter of assigning np.nan into a subset defined by the mask, using the “boolean array indexing” syntax of numpy.\n\nmasked_elev = elev.copy()\nmasked_elev = masked_elev.astype('float64')\nmasked_elev[mask] = np.nan\nmasked_elev\n\narray([[ 1.,  2., nan, nan,  5.,  6.],\n       [ 7.,  8.,  9., nan, nan, 12.],\n       [nan, 14., 15., nan, nan, 18.],\n       [nan, nan, nan, 22., nan, nan],\n       [25., nan, nan, nan, 29., nan],\n       [nan, nan, 33., 34., 35., 36.]])\n\n\nFigure 3.17 shows the original elev raster, the mask raster, and the resulting masked_elev raster.\nrasterio.plot.show(elev);\nrasterio.plot.show(mask);\nrasterio.plot.show(masked_elev);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Raster mask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Output masked raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.17: Subsetting raster values using a boolean mask\n\n\n\nThe “mask” can be create from the array itself, using condition(s). That way, we can replace some values (e.g., values assumed to be wrong) with np.nan, such as in the following example.\n\nelev2 = elev.copy()\nelev2 = elev2.astype('float64')\nelev2[elev2 &lt; 20] = np.nan\nelev2\n\narray([[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, 20., 21., 22., 23., 24.],\n       [25., 26., 27., 28., 29., 30.],\n       [31., 32., 33., 34., 35., 36.]])\n\n\nThis technique is also used to reclassify raster values (see Section 3.3.3).\n\n\n3.3.2 Map algebra\nThe term ‘map algebra’ was coined in the late 1970s to describe a “set of conventions, capabilities, and techniques” for the analysis of geographic raster and (although less prominently) vector data (Tomlin 1994). In this context, we define map algebra more narrowly, as operations that modify or summarize raster cell values, with reference to surrounding cells, zones, or statistical functions that apply to every cell.\nMap algebra operations tend to be fast, because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates, hence the old adage “raster is faster but vector is corrector”. The location of cells in raster datasets can be calculated by using its matrix position and the resolution and origin of the dataset (stored in the raster metadata, Section 1.3.1). For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing. Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.\nMap algebra (or cartographic modeling with raster data) divides raster operations into four subclasses (Tomlin 1990), with each working on one or several grids simultaneously:\n\nLocal or per-cell operations (Section 3.3.3)\nFocal or neighborhood operations. Most often the output cell value is the result of a \\(3 \\times 3\\) input cell block (Section 3.3.4)\nZonal operations are similar to focal operations, but the surrounding pixel grid on which new values are computed can have irregular sizes and shapes (Section 3.3.5)\nGlobal or per-raster operations; that means the output cell derives its value potentially from one or several entire rasters (Section 3.3.6)\n\nThis typology classifies map algebra operations by the number of cells used for each pixel processing step and the type of the output. For the sake of completeness, we should mention that raster operations can also be classified by discipline such as terrain, hydrological analysis, or image classification. The following sections explain how each type of map algebra operations can be used, with reference to worked examples.\n\n\n3.3.3 Local operations\nLocal operations comprise all cell-by-cell operations in one or several layers. Raster algebra is a classical use case of local operations—this includes adding or subtracting values from a raster, squaring and multiplying rasters. Raster algebra also allows logical operations such as finding all raster cells that are greater than a specific value (e.g., 5 in our example below). Local operations are applied using the numpy array operations syntax, as demonstrated below.\nFirst, let’s take the array of elev.tif raster values, which we already read earlier (Section 3.3.1).\n\nelev\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nNow, any element-wise array operation can be applied using numpy arithmetic or conditional operators and functions, comprising local raster operations in spatial analysis terminology. For example elev + elev adds the values of elev to itself, resulting in a raster with double values.\n\nelev + elev\n\narray([[ 2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12],\n       [14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24],\n       [26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36],\n       [38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48],\n       [50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60],\n       [62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nNote that some functions and operators automatically change the data type to accommodate the resulting values, while other operators do not, potentially resulting in overflow (i.e., incorrect values for results beyond the data type range, such as trying to accomodate values above 255 in an int8 array). For example, elev**2 (elev squared) results in overflow. Since the ** operator does not automatically change the data type, leaving it as int8, the resulting array has incorrect values for 16**2, 17**2, etc., which are above 255 and therefore cannot be accomodated.\n\nelev**2\n\narray([[  1,   4,   9,  16,  25,  36],\n       [ 49,  64,  81, 100, 121, 144],\n       [169, 196, 225,   0,  33,  68],\n       [105, 144, 185, 228,  17,  64],\n       [113, 164, 217,  16,  73, 132],\n       [193,   0,  65, 132, 201,  16]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nTo avoid this situation, we can, for instance, transform elev to the standard int64 data type, using .astype before applying the ** operator. That way, all results, up to 36**2 (1296), can be easily accomodated, since the int64 data type supports values up to 9223372036854775807 (Table 7.2).\n\nelev.astype(int)**2\n\narray([[   1,    4,    9,   16,   25,   36],\n       [  49,   64,   81,  100,  121,  144],\n       [ 169,  196,  225,  256,  289,  324],\n       [ 361,  400,  441,  484,  529,  576],\n       [ 625,  676,  729,  784,  841,  900],\n       [ 961, 1024, 1089, 1156, 1225, 1296]])\n\n\nNow we get correct results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nnumpy has the special data types np.int_ and np.float_, which refer to “default” int and float data types. These are platform dependent, but typically resolve to np.int64 and np.float64. Furthermore, the standard Python types int and float refer to those same two numpy types, respectively. Therefore, for example, either of the three objects np.int64, np.int_ and int can be passed to .astype in the above example, with identical result. We’ve used the shortest one, int.\n\n\nFigure 3.18 demonstrates the result of the last two examples (elev+elev and elev.astype(int)**2), and two other ones (np.log(elev) and elev&gt;5).\nrasterio.plot.show(elev + elev, cmap='Oranges');\nrasterio.plot.show(elev.astype(int)**2, cmap='Oranges');\nrasterio.plot.show(np.log(elev), cmap='Oranges');\nrasterio.plot.show(elev &gt; 5, cmap='Oranges');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) elev+elev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) elev.astype(int)**2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) np.log(elev)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) elev&gt;5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.18: Examples of different local operations of the elev raster object: adding two rasters, squaring, applying logarithmic transformation, and performing a logical operation.\n\n\n\nAnother good example of local operations is the classification of intervals of numeric values into groups such as grouping a digital elevation model into low (class 1), middle (class 2) and high (class 3) elevations. Here, the raster values in the ranges 0–12, 12–24 and 24–36 are reclassified to take values 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nrecl = elev.copy()\nrecl[(elev &gt; 0)  & (elev &lt;= 12)] = 1\nrecl[(elev &gt; 12) & (elev &lt;= 24)] = 2\nrecl[(elev &gt; 24) & (elev &lt;= 36)] = 3\n\nFigure 3.19 compares the original elev raster with the reclassified recl one.\nrasterio.plot.show(elev, cmap='Oranges');\nrasterio.plot.show(recl, cmap='Oranges');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reclassified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.19: Reclassifying a continuous raster into three categories.\n\n\n\nThe calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a well-known local (pixel-by-pixel) raster operation. It returns a raster with values between -1 and 1; positive values indicate the presence of living plants (mostly &gt; 0.2). NDVI is calculated from red and near-infrared (NIR) bands of remotely sensed imagery, typically from satellite systems such as Landsat or Sentinel-2. Vegetation absorbs light heavily in the visible light spectrum, and especially in the red channel, while reflecting NIR light, which is emulated in the NVDI formula (Equation 3.1),\n\\[\nNDVI=\\frac{NIR-Red} {NIR+Red}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\n, where \\(NIR\\) is the near-infrared band and \\(Red\\) is the red band.\nLet’s calculate NDVI for the multispectral Landsat satellite file (landsat.tif) of the Zion National Park. The file landsat.tif contains surface reflectance values (range 0-1) in the blue, green, red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. We start by reading the file and extracting the NIR and red bands, which are the fourth and third bands, respectively. Next, we apply the formula to calculate the NDVI values.\n\nlandsat = src_landsat.read()\nnir = landsat[3]\nred = landsat[2]\nndvi = (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting an RGB image using the rasterio.plot.show function, the function assumes that values are in the range [0,1] for floats, or [0,255] for integers (otherwise clipped) and the order of bands is RGB. To “prepare” the multi-band raster for rasterio.plot.show, we therefore reverse the order of the first three bands (to go from B-G-R-NIR to R-G-B), using the [:3] slice to select the first three bands and then the [::-1] slice to reverse the bands order, and divide by the raster maximum to set the maximum value to 1.\n\nlandsat_rgb = landsat[:3][::-1] / landsat.max()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPython slicing notation, which numpy, pandas and geopandas also follow, is object[start:stop:step]. The default is to start from the beginning, go to the end, and use steps of 1. Otherwise, start is inclusive and end is exclusive, whereas negative step values imply going backwards starting from the end. Also, always keep in mind that Python indices start from 0. When subsetting two- or three-dimensional objects, indices for each dimension are separated by commas, where either index can be set to : meaning “all values”. The last dimensions can also be omitted implying :, e.g., to subset the first three bands from a three-dimensional array a we can use either a[:3,:,:] or a[:3].\nIn the above example:\n\nThe slicing expression [:3] therefore means layers 0, 1, 2 (up to 3, exclusive)\nThe slicing expression [::-1] therefore means all (three) bands in reverse order\n\n\n\nFigure 3.20 shows the RGB image and the NDVI values calculated for the Landsat satellite image of the Zion National Park.\nrasterio.plot.show(landsat_rgb, cmap='RdYlGn');\nrasterio.plot.show(ndvi, cmap='Greens');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) RGB image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) NDVI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.20: RGB image and NDVI values calculated for the Landsat satellite image of the Zion National Park\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Focal operations\nWhile local functions operate on one cell at time (though possibly from multiple layers), focal operations take into account a central (focal) cell and its neighbors. The neighborhood (also named kernel, filter or moving window) under consideration is typically of \\(3 \\times 3\\) cells (that is, the central cell and its eight surrounding neighbors), but can take on any other (not necessarily rectangular) shape as defined by the user. A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood, uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell (Figure 3.21). Other names for this operation are spatial filtering and convolution (Burrough, McDonnell, and Lloyd 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.21: Input raster (left) and resulting output raster (right) due to a focal operation—finding the minimum value in \\(3 \\times 3\\) moving windows.\n\n\n\nIn Python, the scipy.ndimage (Virtanen et al. 2020) package has a comprehensive collection of functions to perform filtering of numpy arrays, such as:\n\nscipy.ndimage.minimum_filter,\nscipy.ndimage.maximum_filter,\nscipy.ndimage.uniform_filter (i.e., mean filter),\nscipy.ndimage.median_filter, etc.\n\nIn this group of functions, we define the shape of the moving window with either one of size—a single number (e.g., 3), or tuple (e.g., (3,3)), implying a filter of those dimensions, or footprint—a boolean array, representing both the window shape and the identity of elements being included.\nIn addition to specific built-in filters, convolve—applies the sum function after multiplying by a custom weights array, and generic_filter—makes it possible to pass any custom function, where the user can specify any type of custom window-based calculation.\nFor example, here we apply the minimum filter with window size of 3 on elev. As a result, we now have a new array elev_min, where each value is the minimum in the corresponding \\(3 \\times 3\\) neighborhood in elev.\n\nelev_min = scipy.ndimage.minimum_filter(elev, size=3)\nelev_min\n\narray([[ 1,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n       [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n       [ 7,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11],\n       [13, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],\n       [19, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23],\n       [25, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nSpecial care should be given to the edge pixels – how should they be calculated? The scipy.ndimage filtering functions give several options through the mode parameter (see the documentation of any filtering function, such as scipy.ndimage.median_filter, for the definition of each mode): reflect (the default), constant, nearest, mirror, wrap. Sometimes artificially extending raster edges is considered unsuitable. In other words, we may wish the resulting raster to contain pixel values with “complete” windows only, for example to have a uniform sample size or because values in all directions matter (such as in topographic calculations). There is no specific option not to extend edges in scipy.ndimage. However, to get the same effect, the edges of the filtered array can be assigned with np.nan, in a number of rows and columns according to filter size. For example, when using a filter of size=3, the outermost “layer” of pixels may be assigned with np.nan, reflecting the fact that these pixels have incomplete \\(3 \\times 3\\) neighborhoods (Figure 3.21):\n\nelev_min = elev_min.astype(float)\nelev_min[:, [0, -1]] = np.nan\nelev_min[[0, -1], :] = np.nan\nelev_min\n\narray([[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4., nan],\n       [nan,  7.,  8.,  9., 10., nan],\n       [nan, 13., 14., 15., 16., nan],\n       [nan, 19., 20., 21., 22., nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]])\n\n\nWe can quickly check if the output meets our expectations. In our example, the minimum value has to be always the upper left corner of the moving window (remember we have created the input raster by row-wise incrementing the cell values by one starting at the upper left corner).\nFocal functions or filters play a dominant role in image processing. For example, low-pass or smoothing filters use the mean function to remove extremes. By contrast, high-pass filters, often created with custom neighborhood weights, accentuate features.\nIn the case of categorical data, we can replace the mean with the mode, i.e., the most common value. To demonstrate applying a mode filter, let’s read the small sample categorical raster grain.tif.\n\ngrain = src_grain.read(1)\ngrain\n\narray([[1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2],\n       [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1],\n       [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\n       [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n       [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n       [2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nThere is no built-in filter function for a mode filter in scipy.ndimage, but we can use the scipy.ndimage.generic_filter function along with a custom filtering function, internally utilizing scipy.stats.mode.\n\ngrain_mode = scipy.ndimage.generic_filter(\n    grain, \n    lambda x: scipy.stats.mode(x.flatten())[0], \n    size=3\n)\ngrain_mode = grain_mode.astype(float)\ngrain_mode[:, [0, -1]] = np.nan\ngrain_mode[[0, -1], :] = np.nan\ngrain_mode\n\narray([[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan,  0.,  0.,  0.,  2., nan],\n       [nan,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1., nan],\n       [nan,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1., nan],\n       [nan,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1., nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nscipy.stats.mode is a function to summarize array values, returning the mode (most common value). It is analogous to numpy summary functions and methods, such as .mean or .max. numpy itself does not provide the mode function, however, which is why we use scipy for that.\n\n\nTerrain processing is another important application of focal operations. Such functions are provided by multiple Python packages, including the general purpose xarray package, and more specialized packages such as richdem and pysheds. Useful terrain metrics include:\n\nSlope, measured in units of percent, degreees, or radians (Horn 1981)\nAspect, meaning each cell’s downward slope direction (Horn 1981)\nSlope curvature, including ‘planform’ and ‘profile’ curvature (Zevenbergen and Thorne 1987)\n\nFor example, each of these, and other, terrain metrics can be computed with the richdem package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTerrain metrics are essentially focal filters with customized functions. Using scipy.ndimage.generic_filter, along with such custom functions, is an option for those who would like to calculate terrain metric through coding by hand and/or limiting their code dependencies. For example, the How Aspect works and How Slope works pages from the ArcGIS Pro documentation provide exlanations and formulas of the required funtions for aspect and slope metrics (Figure 3.22), respectively, which can be translated to numpy-based functions to be used in scipy.ndimage.generic_filter to calculate those metrics.\n\n\nAnother extremely fast, memory-efficient, and concise, alternative, is to the use the GDAL program called gdaldem. gdaldem can be used to calculate slope, aspect, and other terrain metrics through a single command, accepting an input file path and exporting the result to a new file. This is our first example in the book where we demonstrate a situation where it may be worthwhile to leave the Python environment, and utilize a GDAL program directly, rather than through their wrappers (such as rasterio and other Python packages), whether to access a computational algorithm not easily accessible in a Python package, or for GDAL’s memory-efficiency and speed benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGDAL contains a collection of over 40 programs, mostly aimed at raster processing. These include programs for fundamental operations, such as gdal_translate (convert between raster file formats), gdalwarp (raster reprojection), gdal_rasterize (rasterize vector features), and gdal_merge.py (raster mosaic), as well as numerous miscellaneous programs. In this book, we use rasterio for the above-mentioned operations, although the GDAL programs are a good alternative for those who are more comfortable with the command line. However, we do use two GDAL programs for tasks that are lacking in rasterio and not well-implemented in other Python packages: gdaldem (this section), and gdal_contour (Section 5.5.3).\n\n\nGDAL, along with all of its programs should be available in your Python environment, since GDAL is a dependency of rasterio. The following example, which should be run from the command line, takes the srtm_32612.tif raster (which we are going to create in Section 6.8, therefore it is in the 'output' directory), calculates slope (in decimal degrees, between 0 and 90), and exports the result to a new file srtm_32612_slope.tif. Note that the arguments of gdaldem are the metric name (slope), then the input file path, and finally the output file path.\n\nos.system('gdaldem slope output/srtm_32612.tif output/srtm_32612_slope.tif')\n\nHere we ran the gdaldem command through os.system, in order to remain in the Python environment, even though we are calling an external program. Alternatively, you can run the standalone command in the command line interface you are using, such as the Anaconda Prompt:\ngdaldem slope output/srtm_32612.tif output/srtm_32612_slope.tif\nReplacing the metric name, we can calculate other terrain properties. For example, here is how we can calculate an aspect raster srtm_32612_aspect.tif, also in degrees (between 0 and 360).\n\nos.system('gdaldem aspect output/srtm_32612.tif output/srtm_32612_aspect.tif')\n\nFigure 3.22 shows the results, using our more familiar plotting methods from rasterio. The code section is relatively long due to the workaround to create a color key (see Section 8.2.3) and removing “No Data” flag values from the arrays so that the color key does not include them. Also note that we are using one of matplotlib’s the cyclic color scales ('twilight') when plotting aspect (Figure 3.22 (c)).\n# Input DEM\nsrc_srtm = rasterio.open('output/srtm_32612.tif')\nsrtm = src_srtm.read(1).astype(float)\nsrtm[srtm == src_srtm.nodata] = np.nan\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm, cmap='Spectral_r', ax=ax)\nfig.colorbar(ax.imshow(srtm, cmap='Spectral_r'), ax=ax);\n# Slope\nsrc_srtm_slope = rasterio.open('output/srtm_32612_slope.tif')\nsrtm_slope = src_srtm_slope.read(1)\nsrtm_slope[srtm_slope == src_srtm_slope.nodata] = np.nan\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm_slope, cmap='Spectral_r', ax=ax)\nfig.colorbar(ax.imshow(srtm_slope, cmap='Spectral_r'), ax=ax);\n# Aspect\nsrc_srtm_aspect = rasterio.open('output/srtm_32612_aspect.tif')\nsrtm_aspect = src_srtm_aspect.read(1)\nsrtm_aspect[srtm_aspect == src_srtm_aspect.nodata] = np.nan\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm_aspect, cmap='twilight', ax=ax)\nfig.colorbar(ax.imshow(srtm_aspect, cmap='twilight'), ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Input DEM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Slope (degrees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Aspect (degrees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.22: Slope and aspect calculation from a DEM\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Zonal operations\nJust like focal operations, zonal operations apply an aggregation function to multiple raster cells. However, a second raster, usually with categorical values, defines the zonal filters (or ‘zones’) in the case of zonal operations, as opposed to a predefined neighborhood window in the case of focal operation presented in the previous section. Consequently, raster cells defining the zonal filter do not necessarily have to be neighbors. Our grain.tif raster is a good example, as illustrated in Figure 1.24: different grain sizes are spread irregularly throughout the raster. Finally, the result of a zonal operation is a summary table grouped by zone, which is why this operation is also known as zonal statistics in the GIS world. This is in contrast to focal operations (Section 3.3.4) which return a raster object.\nTo demonstrate, let’s get back to the grain.tif and elev.tif rasters. To calculate zonal statistics, we use the arrays with raster values, which we already imported earlier. Our intention is to calculate the average (or any other summary function, for that matter) of elevation in each zone defined by grain values. To do that, first we first obtain the unique values defining the zones using np.unique.\n\nnp.unique(grain)\n\narray([0, 1, 2], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nNow, we can use dictionary comprehension to “split” the elev array into separate one-dimensional arrays with values per grain group, with keys being the unique grain values.\n\nz = {i: elev[grain == i] for i in np.unique(grain)}\nz\n\n{0: array([ 2,  7,  9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 35], dtype=uint8),\n 1: array([ 1,  3, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32], dtype=uint8),\n 2: array([ 4,  5,  6,  8, 11, 14, 15, 18, 28, 31, 33, 34, 36], dtype=uint8)}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nList comprehension and dictionary comprehension are concise ways to create a list or a dict, respectively, from an iterable object. Both are, conceptually, a concise syntax to replace for loops where we iterate over an object and return a same-length object with the results. Here are minimal examples of list and dictionary comprehension, respectively, to demonstrate the idea:\n\n[i**2 for i in [2,4,6]]—Returns [4,16,36]\n{i: i**2 for i in [2,4,6]}—Returns {2:4, 4:16, 6:36}\n\nList comprehension is more commonly encountered in practice. We use it in Section 4.2.6, Section 5.4.2, Section 5.5.1, and Section 5.6. Dictionary comprehension is only used in one place in the book (this section).\n\n\nAt this stage, we can expand the dictionary comprehension expression to calculate the mean elevation associated with each grain size class. Namely, instead of placing the elevation values (elev[grain==i]) into the dictionary values, we place their (rounded) mean (elev[grain==i].mean().round(1)).\n\nz = {i: elev[grain == i].mean().round(1) for i in np.unique(grain)}\nz\n\n{0: 14.8, 1: 21.2, 2: 18.7}\n\n\nThis returns the statistics for each category, here the mean elevation for each grain size class. For example, the mean elevation in pixels characterized by grain size 0 is 14.8, and so on.\n\n\n3.3.6 Global operations and distances\nGlobal operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone. The most common global operations are descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset such as the minimum or maximum—we already discussed those in Section 2.3.2.\nAside from that, global operations are also useful for the computation of distance and weight rasters. In the first case, one can calculate the distance from each cell to specific target cells or vector geometries. For example, one might want to compute the distance to the nearest coast (see Section 5.6). We might also want to consider topography, that means, we are not only interested in the pure distance but would like also to avoid the crossing of mountain ranges when going to the coast. To do so, we can weight the distance with elevation so that each additional altitudinal meter “prolongs” the Euclidean distance (this is beyond the scope of the book). Visibility and viewshed computations also belong to the family of global operations (also beyond the scope of the book).\n\n\n3.3.7 Map algebra counterparts in vector processing\nMany map algebra operations have a counterpart in vector processing (Liu and Mason 2009). Computing a distance raster (global operation) while only considering a maximum distance (logical focal operation) is the equivalent to a vector buffer operation (Section 4.2.3). Reclassifying raster data (either local or zonal function depending on the input) is equivalent to dissolving vector data (Section 4.2.7). Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains “No Data” values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (Section Section 4.2.5). Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (Section 3.2.1, Section 3.2.6). The difference is that these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area. However, be careful with the wording. Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for raster and vector data models. While aggregating polygon geometries means dissolving boundaries, for raster data geometries it means increasing cell sizes and thereby reducing spatial resolution. Zonal operations dissolve the cells of one raster in accordance with the zones (categories) of another raster dataset using an aggregating function.\n\n\n3.3.8 Merging rasters\nSuppose we would like to compute the NDVI (see Section 3.3.3), and additionally want to compute terrain attributes from elevation data for observations within a study area. Such computations rely on remotely sensed information. The corresponding source imagery is often divided into scenes covering a specific spatial extent (i.e., “tiles”), and frequently, a study area covers more than one scene. Then, we would need to merge (also known as “mosaic”) the scenes covering our study area. In case when all scenes are “aligned” (i.e., share the same origin and resolution), this can be thought of as simply gluing them into one big raster; otherwise, all scenes need to be resampled (see Section 4.3.3) to the same grid (e.g., the one defined by the first scene).\nFor example, let’s merge digital elevation data from two SRTM elevation tiles, for Austria ('aut.tif') and Switzerland ('ch.tif'). Merging can be done using function rasterio.merge.merge, which accepts a list of raster file connections, and returns the new ndarray and the corresponding “transform” object, representing the resulting mosaic.\n\nsrc_1 = rasterio.open('data/aut.tif')\nsrc_2 = rasterio.open('data/ch.tif')\nout_image, out_transform = rasterio.merge.merge([src_1, src_2])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome Python packages (such as rasterio) are split into several so-called sub-modules. The sub-modules are installed collectively when installing the main package. However, each sub-module needs to be loaded separately to be able to use its functions. For example, the rasterio.merge.merge function (see last code block) comes from the rasterio.merge sub-module of rasterio. Loading rasterio with import rasterio does not expose the rasterio.merge.merge function; instead, we have to load rasterio.merge with import rasterio.merge, and only then use rasterio.merge.merge.\nAlso check out the first code block in this chapter, where we load rasterio as well as three sub-modules: rasterio.plot, rasterio.merge, and rasterio.features.\n\n\nFigure 3.23 shows both inputs and the resulting mosaic.\nrasterio.plot.show(src_1);\nrasterio.plot.show(src_2);\nrasterio.plot.show(out_image, transform=out_transform);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) aut.tif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) ch.tif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Mosaic (aut.tif+ch.tif)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.23: Raster merging\n\n\n\nBy default in rasterio.merge.merge, areas of overlap retain the value of the first raster (method='first'). Other possible methods are:\n\n'last'—Value of the last raster\n'min'—Minimum value\n'max'—Maximum value\n\nWhen dealing with non-overlapping tiles, such as aut.tif and ch.tif (above), the method argument has no practical effect. However, it becomes relevant when we want to combine spectral imagery from scenes that were taken on different dates. The above four options for method do not cover the commonly required scenario when we would like to compute the mean value—for example to calculate a seasonal average NDVI image from a set of partially overlapping satellite images (such as Landsat). An alternative worflow to rasterio.merge.merge, for calculating a mosaic as well as “averaging” any overlaps, is to go through two steps:\n\nResampling all scenes into a common “global” grid (Section 4.3.3), thereby producing a series of “matching” rasters (with the area surrounding each scene set as “No Data”)\nAveraging the rasters through raster algebra (Section 3.3.3), using np.mean(m,axis=0) or np.nanmean(m,axis=0) (depending whether we prefer to ignore “No Data” or not), where m is the multi-band array, which would return a single-band array of averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurrough, P.

    "section": "4.1 Introduction",
    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nSo far the book has explained the structure of geographic datasets (Chapter 1), and how to manipulate them based on their non-geographic attributes (Chapter 2) and spatial relations (Chapter 3). This chapter focuses on manipulating the geographic elements of geographic objects, for example by simplifying and converting vector geometries, and by cropping raster datasets. After reading it you should understand and have control over the geometry column in vector layers and the extent and geographic location of pixels represented in rasters in relation to other geographic objects.\nSection 4.2 covers transforming vector geometries with ‘unary’ and ‘binary’ operations. Unary operations work on a single geometry in isolation, including simplification (of lines and polygons), the creation of buffers and centroids, and shifting/scaling/rotating single geometries using ‘affine transformations’ (Section 4.2.1 to Section 4.2.4). Binary transformations modify one geometry based on the shape of another, including clipping and geometry unions, covered in Section 4.2.5 and Section 4.2.7, respectively. Type transformations (from a polygon to a line, for example) are demonstrated in Section Section 4.2.8.\nSection 4.3 covers geometric transformations on raster objects. This involves changing the size and number of the underlying pixels, and assigning them new values. It teaches how to change the extent and the origin of a raster “manually” (Section 4.3.1), how to change the resolution in fixed “steps” through aggregation and disaggregation (Section 4.3.2), and finally how to resample a raster into any existing template, which is the most general and often most practical approach (Section 4.3.3). These operations are especially useful if one would like to align raster datasets from diverse sources. Aligned raster objects share a one-to-one correspondence between pixels, allowing them to be processed using map algebra operations (Section 3.3.3).\nIn the next chapter (Chapter 5), we deal with the special case of geometry operations that involve both a raster and a vector layer together. It shows how raster values can be ‘masked’ and ‘extracted’ by vector geometries. Importantly it shows how to ‘polygonize’ rasters and ‘rasterize’ vector datasets, making the two data models more interchangeable.",

    "section": "4.2 Geometric operations on vector data",
    "text": "4.2 Geometric operations on vector data\nThis section is about operations that in some way change the geometry of vector layers. It is more advanced than the spatial data operations presented in the previous chapter (in Section 3.2), because here we drill down into the geometry: the functions discussed in this section work on the geometric part (the geometry column, which is a GeoSeries object), either as standalone object or as part of a GeoDataFrame.\n\n4.2.1 Simplification\nSimplification is a process for generalization of vector objects (lines and polygons) usually for use in smaller scale maps. Another reason for simplifying objects is to reduce the amount of memory, disk space and network bandwidth they consume: it may be wise to simplify complex geometries before publishing them as interactive maps. The geopandas package provides the .simplify method, which uses the GEOS implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce the vertex count. .simplify uses tolerance to control the level of generalization in map units (Douglas and Peucker 1973).\nFor example, a simplified geometry of a 'LineString' geometry, representing the river Seine and tributaries, using tolerance of 2000 meters, can be created using the seine.simplify(2000) command (Figure 4.1).\nseine_simp = seine.simplify(2000)\nseine.plot();\nseine_simp.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Simplified (tolerance = 2000 \\(m\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Simplification of the seine line layer\n\n\n\nThe resulting seine_simp object is a copy of the original seine but with fewer vertices. This is apparent, with the result being visually simpler (Figure 4.1, right) and consuming about twice less memory than the original object, as shown in the comparison below.\n\nprint(f'Original: {sys.getsizeof(seine)} bytes')\nprint(f'Simplified: {sys.getsizeof(seine_simp)} bytes')\n\nOriginal: 374 bytes\nSimplified: 188 bytes\n\n\nSimplification is also applicable for polygons. This is illustrated using us_states, representing the contiguous United States. As we show in Chapter 6, for many calculations geopandas (through shapely, and, ultimately, GEOS) assumes that the data is in a projected CRS and this could lead to unexpected results when applying distance-related operators. Therefore, the first step is to project the data into some adequate projected CRS, such as US National Atlas Equal Area (EPSG:9311) (on the left in Figure Figure 4.2), using .to_crs (Section 6.7).\n\nus_states9311 = us_states.to_crs(9311)\n\nThe .simplify method from geopandas works the same way with a 'Polygon'/'MultiPolygon' layer such as us_states9311:\n\nus_states_simp1 = us_states9311.simplify(100000)\n\nA limitation with .simplify, however, is that it simplifies objects on a per-geometry basis. This means the “topology” is lost, resulting in overlapping and “holey” areal units as illustrated in Figure 4.2 (b). The .toposimplify method from package topojson provides an alternative that overcomes this issue. The main advanatage of .toposimplify is that it is topologically “aware”: it simplifies the combined borders of the polygons (rather than each polygon on its own), thus ensuring that the overlap is maintained. The following code chunk uses .toposimplify to simplify us_states9311. Note that, when using the topojson package, we first need to calculate a “topology” object, using function tp.Topology, and then apply the sumplification function, such as .toposimplify, to obtain a simplified layer. We are also using the .to_gdf method to return a GeoDataFrame.\n\ntopo = tp.Topology(us_states9311, prequantize=False)\nus_states_simp2 = topo.toposimplify(100000).to_gdf()\n\nFigure 4.2 compares the original input polygons and two simplification methods applied to us_states9311.\nus_states9311.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black');\nus_states_simp1.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black');\nus_states_simp2.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Simplified using geopandas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Simplified using topojson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Polygon simplification in action, comparing the original geometry of the contiguous United States with simplified versions, generated with functions from the geopandas (middle), and topojson (right), packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Centroids\nCentroid operations identify the center of geographic objects. Like statistical measures of central tendency (including mean and median definitions of ‘average’), there are many ways to define the geographic center of an object. All of them create single point representations of more complex vector objects.\nThe most commonly used centroid operation is the geographic centroid. This type of centroid operation (often referred to as ‘the centroid’) represents the center of mass in a spatial object (think of balancing a plate on your finger). Geographic centroids have many uses, for example to create a simple point representation of complex geometries, to estimate distances between polygons, or to specify the location where polygon text labels are placed. Centroids of the geometries in a GeoSeries or a GeoDataFrame are accessible through the .centroid property, as demonstrated in the code below, which generates the geographic centroids of regions in New Zealand and tributaries to the River Seine (black points in Figure 4.3).\n\nnz_centroid = nz.centroid\nseine_centroid = seine.centroid\n\nSometimes the geographic centroid falls outside the boundaries of their parent objects (think of vector data in shape of a doughnut). In such cases ‘point on surface’ operations, created with the .representative_point method, can be used to guarantee the point will be in the parent object (e.g., for labeling irregular multipolygon objects such as island states), as illustrated by the red points in Figure 4.3. Notice that these red points always lie on their parent objects.\n\nnz_pos = nz.representative_point()\nseine_pos = seine.representative_point()\n\nThe centroids and points in surface are illustrated in Figure 4.3.\n# New Zealand\nbase = nz.plot(color='white', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nnz_centroid.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='black')\nnz_pos.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red');\n# Seine\nbase = seine.plot(color='grey')\nseine_pos.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='red')\nseine_centroid.plot(ax=base, color='None', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Seine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Centroids (black) and points on surface (red) of New Zealand and Seine datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Buffers\nBuffers are polygons representing the area within a given distance of a geometric feature: regardless of whether the input is a point, line or polygon, the output is a polygon (when using positive buffer distance). Unlike simplification, which is often used for visualization and reducing file size, buffering tends to be used for geographic data analysis. How many points are within a given distance of this line? Which demographic groups are within travel distance of this new shop? These kinds of questions can be answered and visualized by creating buffers around the geographic entities of interest.\nFigure 4.4 illustrates buffers of two different sizes (5 and 50 \\(km\\)) surrounding the river Seine and tributaries. These buffers were created with commands below, using the .buffer method, applied to a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame. The .buffer method requires one important argument: the buffer distance, provided in the units of the CRS, in this case, meters.\n\nseine_buff_5km = seine.buffer(5000)\nseine_buff_50km = seine.buffer(50000)\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 4.4.\nseine_buff_5km.plot(color='none', edgecolor=['c', 'm', 'y']);\nseine_buff_50km.plot(color='none', edgecolor=['c', 'm', 'y']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 5 \\(km\\) buffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 50 \\(km\\) buffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Buffers around the Seine dataset of 5 \\(km\\) and 50 \\(km\\). Note the colors, which reflect the fact that one buffer is created per geometry feature.\n\n\n\nNote that both .centroid and .buffer return a GeoSeries object, even when the input is a GeoDataFrame.\n\nseine_buff_5km\n\n0    POLYGON ((657550.332 6852587.97...\n1    POLYGON ((517151.801 6930724.10...\n2    POLYGON ((701519.74 6813075.492...\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nIn the common scenario when the original attributes of the input features need to be retained, you can replace the existing geometry with the new GeoSeries by creating a copy of the original GeoDataFrame and assigning the new buffer GeoSeries to the geometry column.\n\nseine_buff_5km = seine.copy()\nseine_buff_5km.geometry = seine.buffer(5000)\nseine_buff_5km\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nMarne\nPOLYGON ((657550.332 6852587.97...\n\n\n1\nSeine\nPOLYGON ((517151.801 6930724.10...\n\n\n2\nYonne\nPOLYGON ((701519.74 6813075.492...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative option is to add a secondary geometry column directly to the original GeoDataFrame.\n\nseine['geometry_5km'] = seine.buffer(5000)\nseine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ngeometry\ngeometry_5km\n\n\n\n\n0\nMarne\nMULTILINESTRING ((879955.277 67...\nPOLYGON ((657550.332 6852587.97...\n\n\n1\nSeine\nMULTILINESTRING ((828893.615 67...\nPOLYGON ((517151.801 6930724.10...\n\n\n2\nYonne\nMULTILINESTRING ((773482.137 66...\nPOLYGON ((701519.74 6813075.492...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then switch to either geometry column (i.e., make it “active”) using .set_geometry, as in:\n\nseine = seine.set_geometry('geometry_5km')\n\nLet’s revert to the original state of seine before moving on to the next section.\n\nseine = seine.set_geometry('geometry')\nseine = seine.drop('geometry_5km', axis=1)\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Affine transformations\nAffine transformations include, among others, shifting (translation), scaling and rotation, or any combination of these. They preserves lines and parallelism, but angles and lengths are not necessarily preserved. These transformations are an essential part of geocomputation. For example, shifting is needed for labels placement, scaling is used in non-contiguous area cartograms, and many affine transformations are applied when reprojecting or improving the geometry that was created based on a distorted or wrongly projected map.\nThe geopandas package implements affine transformation, for objects of classes GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame. In both cases, the method is applied on the GeoSeries part, returning a just the GeoSeries of transformed geometries.\nAffine transformations of GeoSeries can be done using the .affine_transform method, which is a wrapper around the shapely.affinity.affine_transform function. As documented, a 2D affine transformation requires a six-parameter list [a,b,d,e,xoff,yoff] which represents the following equations for transforming the coordinates (Equation 4.1 and Equation 4.2).\n\\[\nx' = a x + b y + x_\\mathrm{off}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\n\\[\ny' = d x + e y + y_\\mathrm{off}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nThere are also simplified GeoSeries methods for specific scenarios, such as:\n\n.translate(xoff=0.0, yoff=0.0)\n.scale(xfact=1.0, yfact=1.0, origin='center')\n.rotate(angle, origin='center', use_radians=False)\n\nFor example, shifting only requires the \\(x_{off}\\) and \\(y_{off}\\), using .translate. The code below shifts the y-coordinates of nz by 100 \\(km\\) to the north, but leaves the x-coordinates untouched.\n\nnz_shift = nz.translate(0, 100000)\nnz_shift\n\n0     MULTIPOLYGON (((1745493.196 610...\n1     MULTIPOLYGON (((1803822.103 600...\n2     MULTIPOLYGON (((1860345.005 595...\n                     ...                \n13    MULTIPOLYGON (((1616642.877 552...\n14    MULTIPOLYGON (((1624866.278 551...\n15    MULTIPOLYGON (((1686901.914 545...\nLength: 16, dtype: geometry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nshapely, and consequently geopandas, operations, typically ignore the z-dimension (if there is one) of geometries in operations. For example, shapely.LineString([(0,0,0),(0,0,1)]).length returns 0 (and not 1), since .length ignores the z-dimension. In this book (like in most real-world spatial analysis applications), we deal only with two-dimensional geometries.\n\n\nScaling enlarges or shrinks objects by a factor, and can be applied either globally or locally. Global scaling increases or decreases all coordinates values in relation to the origin coordinates, while keeping all geometries topological relations intact. geopandas implements scaling using the .scale method. Local scaling treats geometries independently and requires points around which geometries are going to be scaled, e.g., centroids. In the example below, each geometry is shrunk by a factor of two around the centroids (Figure 4.5 (b)). To achieve that, we pass the 0.5 and 0.5 scaling factors (for x and y, respectively), and the 'centroid' option for the point of origin.\n\nnz_scale = nz.scale(0.5, 0.5, origin='centroid')\nnz_scale\n\n0     MULTIPOLYGON (((1710099.077 603...\n1     MULTIPOLYGON (((1778686.524 591...\n2     MULTIPOLYGON (((1839927.904 582...\n                     ...                \n13    MULTIPOLYGON (((1593619.59 5418...\n14    MULTIPOLYGON (((1628907.395 542...\n15    MULTIPOLYGON (((1665262.436 536...\nLength: 16, dtype: geometry\n\n\nWhen setting the origin in .scale, other than 'centroid' it is possible to use 'center', for the bounding box center, or specific point coordinates, such as (0,0).\nRotating the geometries can be done using the .rotate method. When rotating, we need to specify the rotation angle (positive values imply clockwise rotation) and the origin points (using the same options as in scale). For example, the following expression rotates nz by \\(30\\degree\\) counter-clockwise, around the geometry centroids.\n\nnz_rotate = nz.rotate(-30, origin='centroid')\nnz_rotate\n\n0     MULTIPOLYGON (((1701904.887 597...\n1     MULTIPOLYGON (((1779714.772 587...\n2     MULTIPOLYGON (((1890843.462 582...\n                     ...                \n13    MULTIPOLYGON (((1616991.636 539...\n14    MULTIPOLYGON (((1617733.547 542...\n15    MULTIPOLYGON (((1665898.669 533...\nLength: 16, dtype: geometry\n\n\nFigure 4.5 shows the original layer nz, and the shifting, scaling and rotation results.\n# Shift\nbase = nz.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\nnz_shift.plot(ax=base, color='red', edgecolor='darkgrey');\n# Scale\nbase = nz.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\nnz_scale.plot(ax=base, color='red', edgecolor='darkgrey');\n# Rotate\nbase = nz.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='darkgrey')\nnz_rotate.plot(ax=base, color='red', edgecolor='darkgrey');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Shift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Rotate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Affine transformations of the nz layer: shift, scale and rotate\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Pairwise geometry-generating operations\nSpatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the geometry columns of at least some of the affected features. Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: lines, polygons and their ‘multi’ equivalents. To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example: two overlapping circles with a center point one unit away from each other and a radius of one (Figure 4.6).\n\nx = shapely.Point((0, 0)).buffer(1)\ny = shapely.Point((1, 0)).buffer(1)\nshapely.GeometryCollection([x, y])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Overlapping polygon (circle) geometries x and y\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both x and y. This can be done using the .intersection method from shapely, illustrated using objects named x and y which represent the left- and right-hand circles (Figure 4.7).\n\nx.intersection(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Intersection between x and y\n\n\n\n\n\nMore generally, clipping is an example of a ‘pairwise geometry-generating operation’, where new geometries are generated from two inputs. Other than .intersection (Figure 4.7), there are three other standard pairwise operators: .difference (Figure 4.8), .union (Figure 4.9), and .symmetric_difference (Figure 4.10).\n\nx.difference(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Difference between x and y (namely, x “minus” y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx.union(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Union of x and y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx.symmetric_difference(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Symmetric difference between x and y\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that x and y are interchangeable in all predicates except for .difference, where x.difference(y) means x minus y, whereas y.difference(x) means y minus x.\nThe latter examples demonstrate pairwise operations between individual shapely geometries. The geopandas package, as is often the case, contains wrappers of these shapely functions to be applied to multiple, or pairwise, use cases. For example, applying either of the pairwise methods on a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame, combined with a shapely geometry, returns the pairwise (many-to-one) results (which is analogous to other operators, like .intersects or .distance, see Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.7, respectively).\nLet’s demonstrate the “many-to-one” scenario by calculating the difference between each geometry in a GeoSeries and a “fixed” shapely geometry. To create the latter, let’s take x and combine it with itself translated (Section 4.2.4) to a distance of 1 and 2 units “upwards” on the y-axis.\n\ngeom1 = gpd.GeoSeries(x)\ngeom2 = geom1.translate(0, 1)\ngeom3 = geom1.translate(0, 2)\ngeom = pd.concat([geom1, geom2, geom3])\ngeom\n\n0    POLYGON ((1 0, 0.99518 -0.09802...\n0    POLYGON ((1 1, 0.99518 0.90198,...\n0    POLYGON ((1 2, 0.99518 1.90198,...\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nFigure 4.11 shows the GeoSeries geom with the shapely geometry (in red) that we will intersect with it.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ngeom.plot(color='#00000030', edgecolor='black', ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(y).plot(color='#FF000040', edgecolor='black', ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: A GeoSeries with three circles (in grey), and a shapely geometry that we will “subtract” from it (in red)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, using .intersection automatically applies the shapely method of the same name on each geometry in geom, returning a new GeoSeries, which we name geom_inter_y, with the pairwise “intersections”. Note the empty third geometry (can you explain the meaning of this result?).\n\ngeom_inter_y = geom.intersection(y)\ngeom_inter_y\n\n0    POLYGON ((0.99518 -0.09802, 0.9...\n0    POLYGON ((0.99518 0.90198, 0.98...\n0                         POLYGON EMPTY\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nFigure 4.12 is a plot of the result geom_inter_y.\n\ngeom_inter_y.plot(color='#00000030', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The output GeoSeries, after subtracting a shapely geometry using .intersection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe .overlay method (see Section 3.2.6) further extends this technique, making it possible to apply “many-to-many” pairwise geometry generations between all pairs of two GeoDataFrames. The output is a new GeoDataFrame with the pairwise outputs, plus the attributes of both inputs which were the inputs of the particular pairwise output geometry. Also see the “Set operations with overlay” article in the geopandas documentation for examples of .overlay.\n\n\n4.2.6 Subsetting vs. clipping\nIn the last two chapters we have introduced two types of spatial operators: boolean, such as .intersects (Section 3.2.1), and geometry-generating, such as .intersection (Section 4.2.5). Here, we illustrate the difference between them. We do this using the specific scenario of subsetting points by polygons, where (unlike in other cases) both methods can be used for the same purpose and giving the same result.\nTo illustrate the point, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles x and y from Figure 4.6. Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both, and some will be inside neither. The following code sections generates the sample data for this section, a simple random distribution of points within the extent of circles x and y, resulting in output illustrated in Figure 4.13. We create the sample points in two steps. First, we figure out the bounds where random points are to be generated.\n\nbounds = x.union(y).bounds\nbounds\n\n(-1.0, -1.0, 2.0, 1.0)\n\n\nSecond, we use np.random.uniform to calculate n random x- and y-coordinates within the given bounds.\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\nn = 10\ncoords_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[2], n)\ncoords_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[1], bounds[3], n)\ncoords = list(zip(coords_x, coords_y))\ncoords\n\n[(0.2510660141077219, -0.1616109711934104),\n (1.1609734803264744, 0.370439000793519),\n (-0.9996568755479653, -0.5910955005369651),\n (-0.0930022821044807, 0.7562348727818908),\n (-0.5597323275486609, -0.9452248136041477),\n (-0.7229842156936066, 0.34093502035680445),\n (-0.4412193658669873, -0.16539039526574606),\n (0.03668218112914312, 0.11737965689150331),\n (0.1903024226920098, -0.7192261228095325),\n (0.6164502020100708, -0.6037970218302424)]\n\n\nThird, we transform the list of coordinates into a list of shapely points, and then to a GeoSeries.\n\npnt = [shapely.Point(i) for i in coords]\npnt = gpd.GeoSeries(pnt)\n\nThe result pnt, which x and y circles in the background, is shown in Figure 4.13.\n\nbase = pnt.plot(color='none', edgecolor='black')\ngpd.GeoSeries(x).plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='darkgrey');\ngpd.GeoSeries(y).plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='darkgrey');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can get back to our question: how to subset the points to only return the point that intersects with both x and y? The code chunks below demonstrate two ways to achieve the same result. In the first approach, we can calculate a boolean Series, evaluating whether each point of pnt intersects with the intersection of x and y (see Section 3.2.1), and then use it to subset pnt to get the result pnt1.\n\nsel = pnt.intersects(x.intersection(y))\npnt1 = pnt[sel]\npnt1\n\n0    POINT (0.25107 -0.16161)\n7     POINT (0.03668 0.11738)\n9     POINT (0.61645 -0.6038)\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nIn the second approach, we can also find the intersection between the input points represented by pnt, using the intersection of x and y as the subsetting/clipping object. Since the second argument is an individual shapely geometry (x.intersection(y)), we get “pairwise” intersections of each pnt with it (see Section 4.2.5):\n\npnt2 = pnt.intersection(x.intersection(y))\npnt2\n\n0    POINT (0.25107 -0.16161)\n1                 POINT EMPTY\n2                 POINT EMPTY\n               ...           \n7     POINT (0.03668 0.11738)\n8                 POINT EMPTY\n9     POINT (0.61645 -0.6038)\nLength: 10, dtype: geometry\n\n\nThe subset pnt2 is shown in Figure 4.14.\n\nbase = pnt.plot(color='none', edgecolor='black')\ngpd.GeoSeries(x).plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='darkgrey');\ngpd.GeoSeries(y).plot(ax=base, color='none', edgecolor='darkgrey');\npnt2.plot(ax=base, color='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y. The point that intersects with both objects x and y are highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference between the two approaches is that .intersection returns all “intersections”, even if they are empty.

However, we encourage the reader to reproduce the results to deepen your understanding for handling geographic vector objects in Python.\n\n\n4.2.7 Geometry unions\nSpatial aggregation can silently dissolve the geometries of touching polygons in the same group, as we saw in Section 2.2.2. This is demonstrated in the code chunk below, in which 49 us_states are aggregated into 4 regions using the .dissolve method.\n\nregions = us_states[['REGION', 'geometry', 'total_pop_15']] \\\n    .dissolve(by='REGION', aggfunc='sum').reset_index()\nregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREGION\ngeometry\ntotal_pop_15\n\n\n\n\n0\nMidwest\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-89.10077 36.94...\n67546398.0\n\n\n1\nNorteast\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-75.61724 39.83...\n55989520.0\n\n\n2\nSouth\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-81.3855 30.273...\n118575377.0\n\n\n3\nWest\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-118.36998 32.8...\n72264052.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15 compares the original us_states layer with the aggregated regions layer.\n# States\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 2.5))\nus_states.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='black', column='total_pop_15', legend=True);\n# Regions\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 2.5))\nregions.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='black', column='total_pop_15', legend=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 49 States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 4 Regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: Spatial aggregation on contiguous polygons, illustrated by aggregating the population of 49 US states into 4 regions, with population represented by color.

Behind the scenes, .dissolve combines the geometries and dissolve the boundaries between them using the .union_all method per group. This is demonstrated in the code chunk below which creates a united western US using the standalone .union_all operation. Note that the result is a shapely geometry, as the individual attributes are “lost” as part of dissolving (Figure 4.16).\n\nus_west = us_states[us_states['REGION'] == 'West']\nus_west_union = us_west.geometry.union_all()\nus_west_union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Western US\n\n\n\n\n\nTo dissolve two (or more) groups of a GeoDataFrame into one geometry, we can either (a) use a combined condition or (b) concatenate the two separate subsets and then dissove using .union_all.\n\n# Approach 1\nsel = (us_states['REGION'] == 'West') | (us_states['NAME'] == 'Texas')\ntexas_union = us_states[sel]\ntexas_union = texas_union.geometry.union_all()\n# Approach 2\nus_west = us_states[us_states['REGION'] == 'West']\ntexas = us_states[us_states['NAME'] == 'Texas']\ntexas_union = pd.concat([us_west, texas]).union_all()\n\nThe result is identical in both cases, shown in Figure 4.17.\n\ntexas_union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: Western US and Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.8 Type transformations\nTransformation of geometries, from one type to another, also known as “geometry casting”, is often required to facilitate spatial analysis. Either the geopandas or the shapely packages can be used for geometry casting, depending on the type of transformation, and the way that the input is organized (whether and individual geometry, or a vector layer). Therefore, the exact expression(s) depend on the specific transformation we are interested in.\nIn general, you need to figure out the required input of the respective construstor function according to the “destination” geometry (e.g., shapely.LineString, etc.), then reshape the input of the “source” geometry into the right form to be passed to that function. Or, when available, you can use a wrapper from geopandas.\nIn this section we demonstrate several common scenarios. We start with transformations of individual geometries from one type to another, using shapely methods:\n\n'MultiPoint' to 'LineString' (Figure 4.19)\n'MultiPoint' to 'Polygon' (Figure 4.20)\n'LineString' to 'MultiPoint' (Figure 4.22)\n'Polygon' to 'MultiPoint' (Figure 4.23)\n'Polygon's to 'MultiPolygon' (Figure 4.24)\n'MultiPolygon's to 'Polygon's (Figure 4.25, Figure 4.26)\n\nThen, we move on and demonstrate casting workflows on GeoDataFrames, where we have further considerations, such as keeping track of geometry attributes, and the possibility of dissolving, rather than just combining, geometries. As we will see, these are done either by “manually” applying shapely methods on all geometries in the given layer, or using geopandas wrapper methods which do it automatically:\n\n'MultiLineString' to 'LineString's (using .explode) (Figure 4.28)\n'LineString' to 'MultiPoint's (using .apply) (Figure 4.29)\n'LineString's to 'MultiLineString' (using .dissolve)\n'Polygon's to 'MultiPolygon' (using .dissolve or .agg) (Figure 4.30)\n'Polygon' to '(Multi)LineString' (using .boundary or .exterior) (demonstrated in a subsequent chapter, see Section 5.4.2)\n\nLet’s start with the simple individual-geometry casting examples, to illustrate how geometry casting works on shapely geometry objects. First, let’s create a 'MultiPoint' (Figure 4.18).\n\nmultipoint = shapely.MultiPoint([(1,1), (3,3), (5,1)])\nmultipoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: A 'MultiPoint' geometry used to demonstrate shapely type transformations\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'LineString' can be created using shapely.LineString from a list of points. Thus, a 'MultiPoint' can be converted to a 'LineString' by passing the points into a list, then passing them to shapely.LineString (Figure 4.19). The .geoms property, mentioned in Section 1.2.5, give access to the indivudual parts that comprise a multi-part geometry, as an iterable object similar to a list; it is one of the shapely access methods to internal parts of a geometry.  \n\nlinestring = shapely.LineString(multipoint.geoms)\nlinestring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: A 'LineString' created from the 'MultiPoint' in Figure 4.18\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a 'Polygon' can be created using function shapely.Polygon, which accepts a sequence of point coordinates. In principle, the last coordinate must be equal to the first, in order to form a closed shape. However, shapely.Polygon is able to complete the last coordinate automatically, and therefore we can pass all of the coordinates of the 'MultiPoint' directly to shapely.Polygon (Figure 4.20).\n\npolygon = shapely.Polygon(multipoint.geoms)\npolygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.20: A 'Polygon' created from the 'MultiPoint' in Figure 4.18\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source 'MultiPoint' geometry, and the derived 'LineString' and 'Polygon' geometries are shown in Figure 4.21. Note that we convert the shapely geometries to GeoSeries to be able to use the geopandas .plot method.\ngpd.GeoSeries(multipoint).plot();\ngpd.GeoSeries(linestring).plot();\ngpd.GeoSeries(polygon).plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) MultiPoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) LineString\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Polygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21: Examples of 'LineString’ and 'Polygon' casted from a 'MultiPoint' geometry\n\n\n\nConversion from 'MultiPoint' to 'LineString', shown above (Figure 4.19), is a common operation that creates a line object from ordered point observations, such as GPS measurements or geotagged media. This allows spatial operations such as the length of the path traveled. Conversion from 'MultiPoint' or 'LineString' to 'Polygon' (Figure 4.20) is often used to calculate an area, for example from the set of GPS measurements taken around a lake or from the corners of a building lot.\nOur 'LineString' geometry can be converted back to a 'MultiPoint' geometry by passing its coordinates directly to shapely.MultiPoint (Figure 4.22).\n\nshapely.MultiPoint(linestring.coords)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.22: A 'MultiPoint' created from the 'LineString' in Figure 4.19\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'Polygon' (exterior) coordinates can be passed to shapely.MultiPoint, to go back to a 'MultiPoint' geometry, as well (Figure 4.23).\n\nshapely.MultiPoint(polygon.exterior.coords)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.23: A 'MultiPoint' created from the 'Polygon' in Figure 4.20\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these methods, we can transform between 'Point', 'LineString', and 'Polygon' geometries, assuming there is a sufficient number of points (at least two for a line, and at least three for a polygon). When dealing with multi-part geometries using shapely, we can:\n\nAccess single-part geometries (e.g., each 'Polygion' in a 'MultiPolygon' geometry) using .geoms[i], where i is the index of the geometry\nCombine single-part geometries into a multi-part geometry, by passing a list of the latter to the constructor function\n\nFor example, here is how we combine two 'Polygon' geometries into a 'MultiPolygon' (while also using a shapely affine function shapely.affinity.translate, which is underlying the geopandas .translate method used earlier, see Section 4.2.4) (Figure 4.24):\n\nmultipolygon = shapely.MultiPolygon([\n    polygon, \n    shapely.affinity.translate(polygon.centroid.buffer(1.5), 3, 2)\n])\nmultipolygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.24: A 'MultiPolygon' created from the 'Polygon' in Figure 4.20 and another polygon\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven multipolygon, here is how we can get back the 'Polygon' part 1 (Figure 4.25):\n\nmultipolygon.geoms[0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.25: The 1st “part” extracted from the 'MultiPolygon' in Figure 4.24\n\n\n\n\n\nand part 2 (Figure 4.26):\n\nmultipolygon.geoms[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.26: The 2nd “part” extracted from the 'MultiPolygon' in Figure 4.24\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, dealing with multi-part geometries can be easier with geopandas. Thanks to the fact that geometries in a GeoDataFrame are associated with attributes, we can keep track of the origin of each geometry: duplicating the attributes when going from multi-part to single-part (using .explode, see below), or “collapsing” the attributes through aggregation when going from single-part to multi-part (using .dissolve, see Section 4.2.7).\nLet’s demonstrate going from multi-part to single-part (Figure 4.28) and then back to multi-part (Section 4.2.7), using a small line layer. As input, we will create a 'MultiLineString' geometry composed of three lines (Figure 4.27).\n\nl1 = shapely.LineString([(1, 5), (4, 3)])\nl2 = shapely.LineString([(4, 4), (4, 1)])\nl3 = shapely.LineString([(2, 2), (4, 2)])\nml = shapely.MultiLineString([l1, l2, l3])\nml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.27: A 'MultiLineString' geometry composed of three lines\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s place it into a GeoSeries.\n\ngeom = gpd.GeoSeries(ml)\ngeom\n\n0    MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 3), (4...\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nThen, put it into a GeoDataFrame with an attribute called 'id':\n\ndat = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=geom, data=pd.DataFrame({'id': [1]}))\ndat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nMULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 3), (4...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can imagine it as a road or river network. The above layer dat has only one row that defines all the lines. This restricts the number of operations that can be done, for example it prevents adding names to each line segment or calculating lengths of single lines. Using shapely methods with which we are already familiar with (see above), the individual single-part geometries (i.e., the “parts”) can be accessed through the .geoms property.\n\nlist(ml.geoms)\n\n[&lt;LINESTRING (1 5, 4 3)&gt;, &lt;LINESTRING (4 4, 4 1)&gt;, &lt;LINESTRING (2 2, 4 2)&gt;]\n\n\nHowever, specifically for the “multi-part to single part” type transformation scenarios, there is also a method called .explode, which can convert an entire multi-part GeoDataFrame to a single-part one. The advantage is that the original attributes (such as id) are retained, so that we can keep track of the original multi-part geometry properties that each part came from. The index_parts=True argument also lets us keep track of the original multipart geometry indices, and part indices, named level_0 and level_1, respectively.\n\ndat1 = dat.explode(index_parts=True).reset_index()\ndat1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevel_0\nlevel_1\nid\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\nLINESTRING (1 5, 4 3)\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\nLINESTRING (4 4, 4 1)\n\n\n2\n0\n2\n1\nLINESTRING (2 2, 4 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, here we see that all 'LineString' geometries came from the same multi-part geometry (level_0=0), which had three parts (level_1=0,1,2). Figure 4.28 demonstrates the effect of .explode in converting a layer with multi-part geometries into a layer with single part geometries.\ndat.plot(column='id', linewidth=7);\ndat1.plot(column='level_1', linewidth=7);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) MultiLineString layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) LineString layer, after applying .explode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.28: Transformation a 'MultiLineString' layer with one feature, into a 'LineString' layer with three features, using .explode\n\n\n\nAs a side-note, let’s demonstrate how the above shapely casting methods can be translated to geopandas. Suppose that we want to transform dat1, which is a layer of type 'LineString' with three features, to a layer of type 'MultiPoint' (also with three features). Recall that for a single geometry, we use the expression shapely.MultiPoint(x.coords), where x is a 'LineString' (Figure 4.22). When dealing with a GeoDataFrame, we wrap the conversion into .apply, to apply it on all geometries:\n\ndat2 = dat1.copy()\ndat2.geometry = dat2.geometry.apply(lambda x: shapely.MultiPoint(x.coords))\ndat2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevel_0\nlevel_1\nid\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\nMULTIPOINT (1 5, 4 3)\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\nMULTIPOINT (4 4, 4 1)\n\n\n2\n0\n2\n1\nMULTIPOINT (2 2, 4 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is illustrated in Figure 4.29.\ndat1.plot(column='level_1', linewidth=7);\ndat2.plot(column='level_1', markersize=50);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) LineString layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) MultiPoint layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.29: Transformation a 'LineString' layer with three features, into a 'MultiPoint' layer (also with three features), using .apply and shapely methods\n\n\n\nThe opposite transformation, i.e., “single-part to multi-part”, is achieved using the .dissolve method (which we are already familiar with, see Section 4.2.7). For example, here is how we can get from the 'LineString' layer with three features back to the 'MultiLineString' layer with one feature (since, in this case, there is just one “group”):\n\ndat1.dissolve(by='id').reset_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ngeometry\nlevel_0\nlevel_1\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nMULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 3), (4...\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next code chunk is another example, dissolving the 16 polygons in nz into two geometries of the north and south parts (i.e., the two 'Island' “groups”).\n\nnz_dis1 = nz[['Island', 'Population', 'geometry']] \\\n    .dissolve(by='Island', aggfunc='sum') \\\n    .reset_index()\nnz_dis1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland\ngeometry\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n0\nNorth\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1865558.829 546...\n3671600.0\n\n\n1\nSouth\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1229729.735 479...\n1115600.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that .dissolve not only combines single-part into multi-part geometries, but also dissolves any internal borders. So, in fact, the resulting geometries may be single-part (in case when all parts touch each other, unlike in nz). If, for some reason, we want to combine geometries into multi-part without dissolving, we can fall back to the pandas .agg method (custom table aggregation), supplemented with a shapely function specifying how exactly we want to transform each group of geometries into a new single geometry. In the following example, for instance, we collect all 'Polygon' and 'MultiPolygon' parts of nz into a single 'MultiPolygon' geometry with many separate parts (i.e., without dissolving), per group.\n\nnz_dis2 = nz \\\n    .groupby('Island') \\\n    .agg({\n        'Population': 'sum',\n        'geometry': lambda x: shapely.MultiPolygon(x.explode().to_list())\n    }) \\\n    .reset_index()\nnz_dis2 = gpd.GeoDataFrame(nz_dis2).set_geometry('geometry').set_crs(nz.crs)\nnz_dis2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland\nPopulation\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nNorth\n3671600.0\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1745493.196 600...\n\n\n1\nSouth\n1115600.0\nMULTIPOLYGON (((1557042.169 531...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the last two results nz_dis1 and nz_dis2 (with and without dissolving, respectively) is not evident in the printout: in both cases we got a layer with two features of type 'MultiPolygon'. However, in the first case internal borders were dissolved, while in the second case they were not. This is illustrated in Figure 4.30:\nnz_dis1.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black');\nnz_dis2.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Dissolving (using the geopandas .dissolve method)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Combining into multi-part without dissolving (using .agg and a custom shapely-based function)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.30: Combining New Zealand geometries into one, for each island, with and witout dissolving\n\n\n\nIt is also worthwhile to note the .boundary and .exterior properties of GeoSeries, which are used to cast polygons to lines, with or without interior rings, respectively (see Section 5.4.2).",

    "text": "4.3 Geometric operations on raster data\nGeometric raster operations include the shift, flipping, mirroring, scaling, rotation or warping of images. These operations are necessary for a variety of applications including georeferencing, used to allow images to be overlaid on an accurate map with a known CRS (Liu and Mason 2009). A variety of georeferencing techniques exist, including:\n\nGeorectification based on known ground control points\nOrthorectification, which also accounts for local topography\nImage registration is used to combine images of the same thing but shot from different sensors, by aligning one image with another (in terms of coordinate system and resolution)\n\nPython is rather unsuitable for the first two points since these often require manual intervention which is why they are usually done with the help of dedicated GIS software. On the other hand, aligning several images is possible in Python and this section shows among others how to do so. This often includes changing the extent, the resolution and the origin of an image. A matching projection is of course also required but is already covered in Section 6.8.\nIn any case, there are other reasons to perform a geometric operation on a single raster image. For instance, a common reason for aggregating a raster is to decrease run-time or save disk space. Of course, this approach is only recommended if the task at hand allows a coarser resolution of raster data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Extent and origin\nWhen merging or performing map algebra on rasters, their resolution, projection, origin and/or extent have to match. Otherwise, how should we add the values of one raster with a resolution of 0.2 decimal degrees to a second raster with a resolution of 1 decimal degree? The same problem arises when we would like to merge satellite imagery from different sensors with different projections and resolutions. We can deal with such mismatches by aligning the rasters. Typically, raster alignment is done through resampling—that way, it is guaranteed that the rasters match exactly (Section 4.3.3). However, sometimes it can be useful to modify raster placement and extent “manually”, by adding or removing rows and columns, or by modifying the origin, that is, slightly shifting the raster. Sometimes, there are reasons other than alignment with a second raster for manually modifying raster extent and placement. For example, it may be useful to add extra rows and columns to a raster prior to focal operations, so that it is easier to operate on the edges.\nLet’s demostrate the first operation, raster padding. First, we will read the array with the elev.tif values:\n\nr = src_elev.read(1)\nr\n\narray([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],\n       [ 7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12],\n       [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],\n       [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\n       [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nTo pad an ndarray, we can use the np.pad function. The function accepts an array, and a tuple of the form ((rows_top,rows_bottom),(columns_left, columns_right)). Also, we can specify the value that’s being used for padding with constant_values (e.g., 18). For example, here we pad r with one extra row and two extra columns, on both sides, resulting in the array r_pad:\n\nrows = 1\ncols = 2\nr_pad = np.pad(r, ((rows,rows),(cols,cols)), constant_values=18)\nr_pad\n\narray([[18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 18, 18],\n       [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nHowever, for r_pad to be used in any spatial operation, we also have to update its transformation matrix. Whenever we add extra columns on the left, or extra rows on top, the raster origin changes. To reflect this fact, we have to take to “original” origin and add the required multiple of pixel widths or heights (i.e., raster resolution steps). The transformation matrix of a raster is accessible from the raster file metadata (Section 1.3.2) or, as a shortcut, through the .transform property of the raster file connection. For example, the next code chunk shows the transformation matrix of elev.tif.\n\nsrc_elev.transform \n\nAffine(0.5, 0.0, -1.5,\n       0.0, -0.5, 1.5)\n\n\nFrom the transformation matrix, we are able to extract the origin.\n\nxmin, ymax = src_elev.transform[2], src_elev.transform[5]\nxmin, ymax\n\n(-1.5, 1.5)\n\n\nWe can also get the resolution of the data, which is the distance between two adjacent pixels.\n\ndx, dy = src_elev.transform[0], src_elev.transform[4]\ndx, dy\n\n(0.5, -0.5)\n\n\nThese two parts of information are enough to calculate the new origin (xmin_new,ymax_new) of the padded raster.\n\nxmin_new = xmin - dx * cols\nymax_new = ymax - dy * rows\nxmin_new, ymax_new\n\n(-2.5, 2.0)\n\n\nUsing the updated origin, we can update the transformation matrix (Section 1.3.2). Keep in mind that the meaning of the last two arguments is xsize, ysize, so we need to pass the absolute value of dy (since it is negative).\n\nnew_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=xmin_new, \n    north=ymax_new, \n    xsize=dx, \n    ysize=abs(dy)\n)\nnew_transform\n\nAffine(0.5, 0.0, -2.5,\n       0.0, -0.5, 2.0)\n\n\nFigure 4.31 shows the padded raster, with the outline of the original elev.tif (in red), demonstrating that the origin was shifted correctly and the new_transform works fine.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(r_pad, transform=new_transform, cmap='Greys', ax=ax)\nelev_bbox = gpd.GeoSeries(shapely.box(*src_elev.bounds))\nelev_bbox.plot(color='none', edgecolor='red', ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.31: The padded elev.tif raster, and the extent of the original elev.tif raster (in red)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can shift a raster origin not just when padding, but in any other use case, just by changing its transformation matrix. The effect is that the raster is going to be shifted (which is analogous to .translate for shifting a vector layer, see Section 4.2.4). Manually shifting a raster to arbitrary distance is rarely needed in real-life scenarios, but it is useful to know how to do it at least for better understanding the concept of raster origin. As an example, let’s shift the origin of elev.tif by (-0.25,0.25). First, we need to calculate the new origin.\n\nxmin_new = xmin - 0.25  # shift xmin to the left\nymax_new = ymax + 0.25  # shift ymax upwards\nxmin_new, ymax_new\n\n(-1.75, 1.75)\n\n\nTo shift the origin in other directions we should change the two operators (-, +) accordingly.\nThen, same as when padding (see above), we create an updated transformation matrix.\n\nnew_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=xmin_new, \n    north=ymax_new, \n    xsize=dx, \n    ysize=abs(dy)\n)\nnew_transform\n\nAffine(0.5, 0.0, -1.75,\n       0.0, -0.5, 1.75)\n\n\nFigure 4.32 shows the shifted raster and the outline of the original elev.tif raster (in red).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(r, transform=new_transform, cmap='Greys', ax=ax)\nelev_bbox.plot(color='none', edgecolor='red', ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.32: The elev.tif raster shifted by (0.25,0.25), and its original extent (in red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Aggregation and disaggregation\nRaster datasets vary based on their resolution, from high resolution datasets that enable individual trees to be seen, to low resolution datasets covering large swaths of the Earth. Raster datasets can be transformed to either decrease (aggregate) or increase (disaggregate) their resolution, for a number of reasons. For example, aggregation can be used to reduce computational resource requirements of raster storage and subsequent steps, while disaggregation can be used to match other datasets, or to add detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRaster aggregation is, in fact, a special case of raster resampling (see Section 4.3.3), where the target raster grid is aligned with the original raster, only with coarser pixels. Conversely, raster resampling is the general case where the new grid is not necessarily an aggregation of the original one, but any other type of grid (i.e., shifted and or having increased/reduced resolution, by any factor).\n\n\nAs an example, we here change the spatial resolution of dem.tif by a factor of 5 (Figure 4.33). To aggregate a raster using rasterio, we go through two steps:\n\nReading the raster values (using .read) into an out_shape that is different from the original .shape\nUpdating the transform according to out_shape\n\nLet’s demonstrate it, using the dem.tif file. Note the original shape of the raster; it has 117 rows and 117 columns.\n\nsrc.read(1).shape\n\n(117, 117)\n\n\nAlso note the transform, which tells us that the raster resolution is about 30.85 \\(m\\).\n\nsrc.transform\n\nAffine(30.849999999999604, 0.0, 794599.1076146346,\n       0.0, -30.84999999999363, 8935384.324602526)\n\n\nTo aggregate, instead of reading the raster values the usual way, as in src.read(1), we can specify out_shape to read the values into a different shape. Here, we calculate a new shape which is downscaled by a factor of 5, i.e., the number of rows and columns is multiplied by 0.2. We must truncate any “partial” rows and columns, e.g., using int. Each new pixel is now obtained, or “resampled”, from \\(\\sim 5 \\times 5 = \\sim 25\\) “old” raster values. It is crucial to choose an appropriate resampling method through the resampling parameter. Here we use rasterio.enums.Resampling.average, i.e., the new “large” pixel value is the average of all coinciding small pixels, which makes sense for our elevation data in dem.tif. See Section 4.3.3 for a list of other available methods.\n\nfactor = 0.2\nr = src.read(1,\n    out_shape=(\n        int(src.height * factor),\n        int(src.width * factor)\n        ),\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.average\n)\n\nAs expected, the resulting array r has ~5 times smaller dimensions, as shown below.\n\nr.shape\n\n(23, 23)\n\n\nWhat’s left to be done is the second step, to update the transform, taking into account the change in raster shape. This can be done as follows, using .transform.scale.\n\nnew_transform = src.transform * src.transform.scale(\n    (src.width / r.shape[1]),\n    (src.height / r.shape[0])\n)\nnew_transform\n\nAffine(156.93260869565017, 0.0, 794599.1076146346,\n       0.0, -156.9326086956198, 8935384.324602526)\n\n\nFigure 4.33 shows the original raster and the aggregated one.\nrasterio.plot.show(src);\nrasterio.plot.show(r, transform=new_transform);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Aggregated (using average resampling)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.33: Aggregating a raster by a factor of 5, using average resampling\n\n\n\nThis is a good opportunity to demonstrate exporting a raster with modified dimensions and transformation matrix. We can update the raster metadata required for writing with the update method.\n\ndst_kwargs = src.meta.copy()\ndst_kwargs.update({\n    'transform': new_transform,\n    'width': r.shape[1],\n    'height': r.shape[0],\n})\ndst_kwargs\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'float32',\n 'nodata': nan,\n 'width': 23,\n 'height': 23,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(32717),\n 'transform': Affine(156.93260869565017, 0.0, 794599.1076146346,\n        0.0, -156.9326086956198, 8935384.324602526)}\n\n\nThen we can create a new file (dem_agg5.tif) in writing mode, and write the values from the aggregated array r into the 1st band of the file (see Section 7.6.2 for a detailed explanation of writing raster files with rasterio).\n\ndst = rasterio.open('output/dem_agg5.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\ndst.write(r, 1)\ndst.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ** syntax in Python is known as variable-length “keyword arguments”. It is used to pass a dictionary of numerous parameter:argument pairs to named arguments of a function. In rasterio.open writing mode, the “keyword arguments” syntax often comes in handy, because, instead of specifying each and every property of a new file, we pass a (modified) .meta dictionary based on another, template, raster.\nTechnically, keep in mind that the expression:\nrasterio.open('out.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\nwhere dst_kwargs is a dict of the following form (typically coming from a template raster, possibly with few “updated” properties using .update, see above):\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'float32',\n 'nodata': nan,\n ...\n}\nis a shortcut of:\nrasterio.open(\n    'out.tif', 'w', \n    driver=dst_kwargs['driver'], \n    dtype=dst_kwargs['dtype'], \n    nodata=dst_kwargs['nodata'], \n    ...\n)\n“Positional arguments” is a related technique; see note in Section 6.8.\n\n\nThe opposite operation, namely disaggregation, is when we increase the resolution of raster objects. Either of the supported resampling methods (see Section 4.3.3) can be used. However, since we are not actually summarizing information but transferring the value of a large pixel into multiple small pixels, it makes sense to use either:\n\nNearest neighbor resampling (rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest), when want to keep the original values as-is, since modifying them would be incorrect (such as in categorical rasters)\nSmoothing techniques, such as bilinear resampling (rasterio.enums.Resampling.bilinear), when we would like the smaller pixels to reflect gradual change between the original values, e.g., when the disaggregated raster is used for visualization purposes\n\nTo disaggregate a raster, we go through exactly the same workflow as for aggregation, only using a different scaling factor, such as factor=5 instead of factor=0.2, i.e., increasing the number of raster pixels instead of decreasing. In the example below, we disaggregate using bilinear interpolation, to get a smoothed high-resolution raster.\n\nfactor = 5\nr2 = src.read(1,\n    out_shape=(\n        int(src.height * factor),\n        int(src.width * factor)\n        ),\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.bilinear\n)\n\nAs expected, the dimensions of the disaggregated raster are this time ~5 times bigger than the original ones.\n\nr2.shape\n\n(585, 585)\n\n\nTo calculate the new transform, we use the same expression as for aggregation, only with the new r2 shape.\n\nnew_transform2 = src.transform * src.transform.scale(\n    (src.width / r2.shape[1]),\n    (src.height / r2.shape[0])\n)\nnew_transform2\n\nAffine(6.169999999999921, 0.0, 794599.1076146346,\n       0.0, -6.169999999998726, 8935384.324602526)\n\n\nThe original raster dem.tif was already quite detailed, so it would be difficult to see any difference when plotting it along with the disaggregation result. A zoom-in of a small section of the rasters works better. Figure 4.34 shows the top-left corners of the original raster and the disaggregated one, demonstrating the increase in the number of pixels through disaggregation.\nrasterio.plot.show(src.read(1)[:5, :5], transform=src.transform);\nrasterio.plot.show(r2[:25, :25], transform=new_transform2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Disaggregated (using bilinear resampling)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.34: Disaggregating a raster by a factor of 5, using bilinear tresampling. Only the a small portion (top-left corner) of the rasters is shown, to zoom-in and demonstrate the effect of disaggregation.\n\n\n\nCode to export the disaggregated raster would be identical to the one used above for the aggregated raster.\n\n\n4.3.3 Resampling\nRaster aggregation and disaggregation (Section 4.3.2) are only suitable when we want to change just the resolution of our raster by a fixed factor. However, what to do when we have two or more rasters with different resolutions and origins? This is the role of resampling—a process of computing values for new pixel locations. In short, this process takes the values of our original raster and recalculates new values for a target raster with custom resolution and origin (Figure 4.35).\nThere are several methods for estimating values for a raster with different resolutions/origins (Figure 4.35). The main resampling methods include:\n\nNearest neighbor—assigns the value of the nearest cell of the original raster to the cell of the target one. This is a fast simple technique that is usually suitable for resampling categorical rasters\nBilinear interpolation—assigns a weighted average of the four nearest cells from the original raster to the cell of the target one. This is the fastest method that is appropriate for continuous rasters\nCubic interpolation—uses values of the 16 nearest cells of the original raster to determine the output cell value, applying third-order polynomial functions. Used for continuous rasters and results in a smoother surface compared to bilinear interpolation, but is computationally more demanding\nCubic spline interpolation—also uses values of the 16 nearest cells of the original raster to determine the output cell value, but applies cubic splines (piecewise third-order polynomial functions). Used for continuous rasters\nLanczos windowed sinc resampling—uses values of the 36 nearest cells of the original raster to determine the output cell value. Used for continuous rasters\nAdditionally, we can use straightforward summary methods, taking into account all pixels that coincide with the target pixel, such as average (Figure 4.33), minimum, maximum (Figure 4.35), median, mode, and sum\n\nThe above explanation highlights that only nearest neighbor resampling is suitable for categorical rasters, while all remaining methods can be used (with different outcomes) for continuous rasters.\nWith rasterio, resampling can be done using the rasterio.warp.reproject function. To clarify this naming convention, note that raster reprojection is not fundamentally different from resampling—the difference is just whether the target grid is in the same CRS as the origin (resampling) or in a different CRS (reprojection). In other words, reprojection is resampling into a grid that is in a different CRS. Accordingly, both resampling and reprojection are done using the same function rasterio.warp.reproject. We will demonstrate reprojection using rasterio.warp.reproject later in Section 6.8.\nThe information required for rasterio.warp.reproject, whether we are resampling or reprojecting, is:\n\nThe source and target CRS. These may be identical, when resampling, or different, when reprojecting\nThe source and target transform\n\nImportantly, rasterio.warp.reproject can work with file connections, such as a connection to an output file in write ('w') mode. This makes the function efficient for large rasters.\nThe target and destination CRS are straightforward to specify, depending on our choice. The source transform is also readily available, through the .transform property of the source file connection. The only complicated part is to figure out the destination transform. When resampling, the transform is typically derived either from a template raster, such as an existing raster file that we would like our origin raster to match, or from a numeric specification of our target grid (see below). Otherwise, when the exact grid is not of importance, we can simply aggregate or disaggregate our raster as shown above (Section 4.3.2). (Note that when reprojecting, the target transform is more difficult to figure out, therefore we further use the rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform function to compute it, as will be shown in Section 6.8.)\nFinally, the resampling method is specified through the resampling parameter of rasterio.warp.reproject. The default is nearest neighbor resampling. However, as mentioned above, you should be aware of the distiction between resampling methods, and choose the appropriate one according to the data type (continuous/categorical), the input and output resolution, and resampling purposes. Possible arguments for resampling include:\n\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest—Nearest neighbor\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.bilinear—Bilinear\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.cubic—Cubic\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.lanczos—Lanczos windowed\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.average—Average\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.mode—Mode. i.e., most common value\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.min—Minimum\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.max—Maximum\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.med—Median\nrasterio.enums.Resampling.sum—Median\n\nLet’s demonstrate resampling into a destination grid which is specified through numeric constraints, such as the extent and resolution. Again, these could have been specified manually (such as here), or obtained from a template raster metadata that we would like to match. Note that the resolution of the destination grid is ~10 times more coarse (300 \\(m\\)) than the original resolution of dem.tif (~30 \\(m\\)) (Figure 4.35).\n\nxmin = 794650\nxmax = 798250\nymin = 8931750 \nymax = 8935350\nres = 300\n\nThe corresponding transform based on these constraints can be created using the rasterio.transform.from_origin function, as follows:\n\ndst_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=xmin, \n    north=ymax, \n    xsize=res, \n    ysize=res\n)\ndst_transform\n\nAffine(300.0, 0.0, 794650.0,\n       0.0, -300.0, 8935350.0)\n\n\nIn case we needed to resample into a grid specified by an existing “template” raster, we could have skipped this step and simply read the transform from the template file, as in rasterio.open('template.tif').transform.\nNow, we can move on to creating the destination file connection. For that, we also have to know the raster dimensions, which can be derived from the extent and the resolution.\n\nwidth = int((xmax - xmin) / res)\nheight = int((ymax - ymin) / res)\nwidth, height\n\n(12, 12)\n\n\nNow we can create the destination file connection. We are using the same metadata as the source file, except for the dimensions and the transform, which are going to be different and reflecting the resampling process.\n\ndst_kwargs = src.meta.copy()\ndst_kwargs.update({\n    'transform': dst_transform,\n    'width': width,\n    'height': height\n})\ndst = rasterio.open('output/dem_resample_nearest.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\n\nFinally, we reproject using function rasterio.warp.reproject. Note that the source and destination are specified using rasterio.band applied on both file connections, reflecting the fact that we operate on a specific layer of the rasters. The resampling method being used here is nearest neighbor resampling (rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest).\n\nrasterio.warp.reproject(\n    source=rasterio.band(src, 1),\n    destination=rasterio.band(dst, 1),\n    src_transform=src.transform,\n    src_crs=src.crs,\n    dst_transform=dst_transform,\n    dst_crs=src.crs,\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest\n)\n\n(Band(ds=&lt;open DatasetWriter name='output/dem_resample_nearest.tif' mode='w'&gt;, bidx=1, dtype='float32', shape=(12, 12)),\n Affine(300.0, 0.0, 794650.0,\n        0.0, -300.0, 8935350.0))\n\n\nIn the end, we close the file connection, thus finalizing the new file output/dem_resample_nearest.tif with the resampling result (Figure 4.35).\n\ndst.close()\n\nHere is another code section just to demonstrate a different resampling method, the maximum resampling, i.e., every new pixel gets the maximum value of all the original pixels it coincides with (Figure 4.35). Note that all arguments in the rasterio.warp.reproject function call are identical to the previous example, except for the resampling method.\n\ndst = rasterio.open('output/dem_resample_maximum.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\nrasterio.warp.reproject(\n    source=rasterio.band(src, 1),\n    destination=rasterio.band(dst, 1),\n    src_transform=src.transform,\n    src_crs=src.crs,\n    dst_transform=dst_transform,\n    dst_crs=src.crs,\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.max\n)\ndst.close()\n\nThe original raster dem.tif, and the two resampling results dem_resample_nearest.tif and dem_resample_maximum.tif, are shown in Figure 4.35.\n# Input\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))\nrasterio.plot.show(src, ax=ax);\n# Nearest neighbor\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))\nrasterio.plot.show(rasterio.open('output/dem_resample_nearest.tif'), ax=ax);\n# Maximum\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))\nrasterio.plot.show(rasterio.open('output/dem_resample_maximum.tif'), ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Nearest neighbor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Maximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.35: The original raster dem.tif and two different resampling method results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouglas, David H, and Thomas K Peucker. 1973. “Algorithms for the Reduction of the Number of Points Required to Represent a Digitized Line or Its Caricature.” Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization 10 (2): 112–22. https://doi.org/bjwv52.\n\n\nLiu, Jian-Guo, and Philippa J.

    "section": "5.2 Raster masking and cropping",
    "text": "5.2 Raster masking and cropping\nMany geographic data projects involve integrating data from many different sources, such as remote sensing images (rasters) and administrative boundaries (vectors). Often the extent of input raster datasets is larger than the area of interest. In this case, raster masking, cropping, or both, are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data (Figure 5.2 (b) and (c), and the following two examples, illustrate the difference between masking and cropping). Both operations reduce object memory use and associated computational resources for subsequent analysis steps, and may be a necessary preprocessing step before creating attractive maps involving raster data.\nWe will use two layers to illustrate raster cropping:\n\nThe srtm.tif raster representing elevation, in meters above sea level, in south-western Utah: a rasterio file connection named src_srtm (see Figure 5.2 (a))\nThe zion.gpkg vector layer representing the Zion National Park boundaries (a GeoDataFrame named zion)\n\nBoth target and cropping objects must have the same projection. Since it is easier and more precise to reproject vector layers, compared to rasters, we use the following expression to reproject (Section 6.7) the vector layer zion into the CRS of the raster src_srtm.\n\nzion = zion.to_crs(src_srtm.crs)\n\nTo mask the image, i.e., convert all pixels which do not intersect with the zion polygon to “No Data”, we use the rasterio.mask.mask function.\n\nout_image_mask, out_transform_mask = rasterio.mask.mask(\n    src_srtm, \n    zion.geometry, \n    crop=False, \n    nodata=9999\n)\n\nNote that we need to choose and specify a “No Data” value, within the valid range according to the data type. Since srtm.tif is of type uint16 (how can we check?), we choose 9999 (a positive integer that is guaranteed not to occur in the raster). Also note that rasterio does not directly support geopandas data structures, so we need to pass a “collection” of shapely geometries: a GeoSeries (see above) or a list of shapely geometries (see next example) both work. The output consists of two objects. The first one is the out_image array with the masked values.\n\nout_image_mask\n\narray([[[9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999],\n        [9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999],\n        [9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999],\n        ...,\n        [9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999],\n        [9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999],\n        [9999, 9999, 9999, ..., 9999, 9999, 9999]]], dtype=uint16)\n\n\nThe second one is a new transformation matrix out_transform.\n\nout_transform_mask\n\nAffine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n       0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)\n\n\nNote that masking (without cropping!) does not modify the raster extent. Therefore, the new transform is identical to the original (src_srtm.transform).\nUnfortunately, the out_image and out_transform objects do not contain any information indicating that 9999 represents “No Data”. To associate the information with the raster, we must write it to file along with the corresponding metadata. For example, to write the masked raster to file, we first need to modify the “No Data” setting in the metadata.\n\ndst_kwargs = src_srtm.meta\ndst_kwargs.update(nodata=9999)\ndst_kwargs\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint16',\n 'nodata': 9999,\n 'width': 465,\n 'height': 457,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n        0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)}\n\n\nThen we can write the masked raster to file with the updated metadata object.\n\nnew_dataset = rasterio.open('output/srtm_masked.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\nnew_dataset.write(out_image_mask)\nnew_dataset.close()\n\nNow we can re-import the raster and check that the “No Data” value is correctly set.\n\nsrc_srtm_mask = rasterio.open('output/srtm_masked.tif')\n\nThe .meta property contains the nodata entry. Now, any relevant operation (such as plotting, see Figure 5.2 (b)) will take “No Data” into account.\n\nsrc_srtm_mask.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint16',\n 'nodata': 9999.0,\n 'width': 465,\n 'height': 457,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n        0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)}\n\n\nThe related operation, cropping, reduces the raster extent to the extent of the vector layer:\n\nTo crop and mask, we can use rasterio.mask.mask, same as above for masking, while setting crop=True (Figure 5.2 (d))\nTo just crop, without masking, we can derive the bounding box polygon of the vector layer, and then crop using that polygon, also combined with crop=True (Figure 5.2 (c))\n\nFor the example of cropping only, the extent polygon of zion can be obtained as a shapely geometry object using .union_all().envelope(Figure 5.1).\n\nbb = zion.union_all().envelope\nbb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Bounding box 'Polygon' geometry of the zion layer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent can now be used for masking. Here, we are also using the all_touched=True option so that pixels partially overlapping with the extent are also included in the output.\n\nout_image_crop, out_transform_crop = rasterio.mask.mask(\n    src_srtm, \n    [bb], \n    crop=True, \n    all_touched=True, \n    nodata=9999\n)\n\nIn the case of cropping, there is no particular reason to write the result to file for easier plotting, such as in the other two examples, since there are no “No Data” values (Figure 5.2 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, rasterio functions typically accept vector geometries in the form of lists of shapely objects. GeoSeries are conceptually very similar, and also accepted. However, even an individual geometry has to be in a list, which is why we pass [bb], and not bb, in the above rasterio.mask.mask function call (the latter would raise an error).\n\n\nFinally, the third example is where we perform both crop and mask operations, using rasterio.mask.mask with crop=True passing zion.geometry.\n\nout_image_mask_crop, out_transform_mask_crop = rasterio.mask.mask(\n    src_srtm, \n    zion.geometry, \n    crop=True, \n    nodata=9999\n)\n\nWhen writing the result to file, it is here crucial to update the transform and dimensions, since they were modified as a result of cropping. Also note that out_image_mask_crop is a three-dimensional array (even though it has one band in this case), so the number of rows and columns are in .shape[1] and .shape[2] (rather than .shape[0] and .shape[1]), respectively.\n\ndst_kwargs = src_srtm.meta\ndst_kwargs.update({\n    'nodata': 9999,\n    'transform': out_transform_mask_crop,\n    'width': out_image_mask_crop.shape[2],\n    'height': out_image_mask_crop.shape[1]\n})\nnew_dataset = rasterio.open(\n    'output/srtm_masked_cropped.tif', \n    'w', \n    **dst_kwargs\n)\nnew_dataset.write(out_image_mask_crop)\nnew_dataset.close()\n\nLet’s also create a file connection to the newly created file srtm_masked_cropped.tif in order to plot it (Figure 5.2 (d)).\n\nsrc_srtm_mask_crop = rasterio.open('output/srtm_masked_cropped.tif')\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the original raster, and the three masking and/or cropping results.\n# Original\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5))\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm, ax=ax)\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n# Masked\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5))\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm_mask, ax=ax)\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n# Cropped\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5))\nrasterio.plot.show(out_image_crop, transform=out_transform_crop, ax=ax)\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n# Masked+Cropped\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5))\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm_mask_crop, ax=ax)\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Masked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Cropped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Masked+Cropped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Raster masking and cropping",

    "section": "5.3 Raster extraction",
    "text": "5.3 Raster extraction\nRaster extraction is the process of identifying and returning the values associated with a ‘target’ raster at specific locations, based on a (typically vector) geographic ‘selector’ object. The reverse of raster extraction—assigning raster cell values based on vector objects—is rasterization, described in Section 5.4.\nIn the following examples, we use a package called rasterstats, which is specifically aimed at extracting raster values:\n\nTo points (Section 5.3.1) or to lines (Section 5.3.2), via the rasterstats.point_query function\nTo polygons (Section 5.3.3), via the rasterstats.zonal_stats function\n\n\n5.3.1 Extraction to points\nThe simplest type of raster extraction is getting the values of raster cells at specific points. To demonstrate extraction to points, we will use zion_points, which contains a sample of 30 locations within the Zion National Park (Figure 5.3).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm, ax=ax)\nzion_points.plot(ax=ax, color='black', edgecolor='white');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: 30 point locations within the Zion National Park, with elevation in the background\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following expression extracts elevation values from srtm.tif according to zion_points, using rasterstats.point_query.\n\nresult1 = rasterstats.point_query(\n    zion_points, \n    src_srtm.read(1), \n    nodata = src_srtm.nodata, \n    affine = src_srtm.transform,\n    interpolate='nearest'\n)\n\nThe first two arguments are the vector layer and the array with rastetr values. The nodata and affine arguments are used to align the array values into the CRS, and to correctly treat “No Data” flags. Finally, the interpolate argument controls the way that the cell values are asigned to the point; interpolate='nearest' typically makes more sense, as opposed to the other option interpolate='bilinear' which is the default.\nAlternatively, we can pass a raster file path to rasterstats.point_query, in which case nodata and affine are not necessary, as the function can understand those properties directly from the raster file.\n\nresult2 = rasterstats.point_query(\n    zion_points, \n    'data/srtm.tif',\n    interpolate='nearest'\n)\n\nEither way, the resulting object is a list of raster values, corresponding to zion_points. For example, here are the elevations of the first five points.\n\nresult1[:5]\n\n[1802, 2433, 1886, 1370, 1452]\n\n\nTo get a GeoDataFrame with the original points geometries (and other attributes, if any), as well as the extracted raster values, we can assign the extraction result into a new column. As you can see, both approaches give the same result.\n\nzion_points['elev1'] = result1\nzion_points['elev2'] = result2\nzion_points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\nelev1\nelev2\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-112.91587 37.20013)\n1802\n1802\n\n\n1\nPOINT (-113.09369 37.39263)\n2433\n2433\n\n\n2\nPOINT (-113.02462 37.33466)\n1886\n1886\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n27\nPOINT (-113.03655 37.23446)\n1372\n1372\n\n\n28\nPOINT (-113.13933 37.39004)\n1905\n1905\n\n\n29\nPOINT (-113.09677 37.24237)\n1574\n1574\n\n\n\n\n30 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nThe function supports extracting from just one raster band at a time. When passing an array, we can read the required band (as in, .read(1), .read(2), etc.). When passing a raster file path, we can set the band using the band_num argument (the default being band_num=1).\n\n\n5.3.2 Extraction to lines\nRaster extraction is also applicable with line selectors. The typical line extraction algorithm is to extract one value for each raster cell touched by a line. However, this particular approach is not recommended to obtain values along the transects, as it is hard to get the correct distance between each pair of extracted raster values.\nFor line extraction, a better approach is to split the line into many points (at equal distances along the line) and then extract the values for these points using the “extraction to points” technique (Section 5.3.1). To demonstrate this, the code below creates (see Section 1.2 for recap) zion_transect, a straight line going from northwest to southeast of the Zion National Park.\n\ncoords = [[-113.2, 37.45], [-112.9, 37.2]]\nzion_transect = shapely.LineString(coords)\nprint(zion_transect)\n\nLINESTRING (-113.2 37.45, -112.9 37.2)\n\n\nThe utility of extracting heights from a linear selector is illustrated by imagining that you are planning a hike. The method demonstrated below provides an ‘elevation profile’ of the route (the line does not need to be straight), useful for estimating how long it will take due to long climbs.\nFirst, we need to create a layer consisting of points along our line (zion_transect), at specified intervals (e.g., 250). To do that, we need to transform the line into a projected CRS (so that we work with true distances, in \\(m\\)), such as UTM. This requires going through a GeoSeries, as shapely geometries have no CRS definition nor concept of reprojection (see Section 1.2.6).\n\nzion_transect_utm = gpd.GeoSeries(zion_transect, crs=4326).to_crs(32612)\nzion_transect_utm = zion_transect_utm.iloc[0]\n\nThe printout of the new geometry shows this is still a straight line between two points, only with coordinates in a projected CRS.\n\nprint(zion_transect_utm)\n\nLINESTRING (305399.67208180577 4147066.650206682, 331380.8917453843 4118750.0947884847)\n\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distances, along the line, where points are going to be generated. We do this using np.arange. The result is a numeric sequence starting at 0, going up to line .length, in steps of 250 (\\(m\\)).\n\ndistances = np.arange(0, zion_transect_utm.length, 250)\ndistances[:7]  ## First 7 distance cutoff points\n\narray([   0.,  250.,  500.,  750., 1000., 1250., 1500.])\n\n\nThe distance cutoffs are used to sample (“interpolate”) points along the line. The shapely .interpolate method is used to generate the points, which then are reprojected back to the geographic CRS of the raster (EPSG:4326).\n\nzion_transect_pnt = [zion_transect_utm.interpolate(d) for d in distances]\nzion_transect_pnt = gpd.GeoSeries(zion_transect_pnt, crs=32612) \\\n    .to_crs(src_srtm.crs)\nzion_transect_pnt\n\n0             POINT (-113.2 37.45)\n1      POINT (-113.19804 37.44838)\n2      POINT (-113.19608 37.44675)\n                  ...             \n151    POINT (-112.90529 37.20443)\n152     POINT (-112.90334 37.2028)\n153     POINT (-112.9014 37.20117)\nLength: 154, dtype: geometry\n\n\nFinally, we extract the elevation values for each point in our transect and combine the information with zion_transect_pnt (after “promoting” it to a GeoDataFrame, to accommodate extra attributes), using the point extraction method shown earlier (Section 5.3.1). We also attach the respective distance cutoff points distances.\n\nresult = rasterstats.point_query(\n    zion_transect_pnt, \n    src_srtm.read(1), \n    nodata = src_srtm.nodata, \n    affine = src_srtm.transform,\n    interpolate='nearest'\n)\nzion_transect_pnt = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=zion_transect_pnt)\nzion_transect_pnt['dist'] = distances\nzion_transect_pnt['elev'] = result\nzion_transect_pnt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\ndist\nelev\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-113.2 37.45)\n0.0\n2001\n\n\n1\nPOINT (-113.19804 37.44838)\n250.0\n2037\n\n\n2\nPOINT (-113.19608 37.44675)\n500.0\n1949\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n151\nPOINT (-112.90529 37.20443)\n37750.0\n1837\n\n\n152\nPOINT (-112.90334 37.2028)\n38000.0\n1841\n\n\n153\nPOINT (-112.9014 37.20117)\n38250.0\n1819\n\n\n\n\n154 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nThe information in zion_transect_pnt, namely the 'dist' and 'elev' attributes, can now be used to draw an elevation profile, as illustrated in Figure 5.4.\n# Raster and a line transect\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(zion_transect).plot(ax=ax, color='black')\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='white');\n# Elevation profile\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nzion_transect_pnt.set_index('dist')['elev'].plot(ax=ax)\nax.set_xlabel('Distance (m)')\nax.set_ylabel('Elevation (m)');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Raster and a line transect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Extracted elevation profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Extracting a raster values profile to line\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Extraction to polygons\nThe final type of geographic vector object for raster extraction is polygons. Like lines, polygons tend to return many raster values per vector geometry. For continuous rasters (Figure 5.5 (a)), we typically want to generate summary statistics for raster values per polygon, for example to characterize a single region or to compare many regions. The generation of raster summary statistics, by polygons, is demonstrated in the code below using rasterstats.zonal_stats, which creates a list of summary statistics (in this case a list of length 1, since there is just one polygon).\n\nresult = rasterstats.zonal_stats(\n    zion, \n    src_srtm.read(1), \n    nodata = src_srtm.nodata, \n    affine = src_srtm.transform, \n    stats = ['mean', 'min', 'max']\n)\nresult\n\n[{'min': 1122.0, 'max': 2661.0, 'mean': 1818.211830154405}]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nrasterstats.zonal_stats, just like rasterstats.point_query (Section 5.3.1), supports raster input as file paths, rather than arrays plus nodata and affine arguments.\n\n\nTransformation of the list to a DataFrame (e.g., to attach the derived attributes to the original polygon layer), is straightforward with the pd.DataFrame constructor.\n\npd.DataFrame(result)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\nmax\nmean\n\n\n\n\n0\n1122.0\n2661.0\n1818.21183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there is only one polygon in the example, a DataFrame with a single row is returned. However, if zion was composed of more than one polygon, we would accordingly get more rows in the DataFrame. The result provides useful summaries, for example that the maximum height in the park is 2661 \\(m\\) above see level.\nNote the stats argument, where we determine what type of statistics are calculated per polygon. Possible values other than 'mean', 'min', and 'max' are:\n\n'count'—The number of valid (i.e., excluding “No Data”) pixels\n'nodata'—The number of pixels with ’No Data”\n'majority'—The most frequently occurring value\n'median'—The median value\n\nSee the documentation of rasterstats.zonal_stats for the complete list. Additionally, the rasterstats.zonal_stats function accepts user-defined functions for calculating any custom statistics.\nTo count occurrences of categorical raster values within polygons (Figure 5.5 (b)), we can use masking (Section 5.2) combined with np.unique, as follows.\n\nout_image, out_transform = rasterio.mask.mask(\n    src_nlcd, \n    zion.geometry.to_crs(src_nlcd.crs), \n    crop=False, \n    nodata=9999\n)\ncounts = np.unique(out_image, return_counts=True)\ncounts\n\n(array([ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8, 15], dtype=uint8),\n array([  4205,  98285, 298299, 203701,    235,     62,    679, 852741]))\n\n\nAccording to the result, for example, the value 2 (“Developed” class) appears in 4205 pixels within the Zion polygon.\nFigure 5.5 illustrates the two types of raster extraction to polygons described above.\n# Continuous raster\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm, ax=ax)\nzion.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n# Categorical raster\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_nlcd, ax=ax, cmap='Set3')\nzion.to_crs(src_nlcd.crs).plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Continuous raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Categorical raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Sample data used for continuous and categorical raster extraction to a polygon",

    "section": "5.4 Rasterization",
    "text": "5.4 Rasterization\nRasterization is the conversion of vector objects into their representation in raster objects. Usually, the output raster is used for quantitative analysis (e.g., analysis of terrain) or modeling. As we saw in Chapter 1, the raster data model has some characteristics that make it conducive to certain methods. Furthermore, the process of rasterization can help simplify datasets because the resulting values all have the same spatial resolution: rasterization can be seen as a special type of geographic data aggregation.\nThe rasterio package contains the rasterio.features.rasterize function for doing this work. To make it happen, we need to have the “template” grid definition, i.e., the “template” raster defining the extent, resolution and CRS of the output, in the out_shape (the output dimensions) and transform (the transformation matrix) arguments of rasterio.features.rasterize. In case we have an existing template raster, we simply need to query its .shape and .transform. On the other hand, if we need to create a custom template, e.g., covering the vector layer extent with specified resolution, there is some extra work to calculate both of these objects (see next example).\nAs for the vector geometries and their associated values, the rasterio.features.rasterize function requires the input vector shapes in the form of an iterable object of geometry,value pairs, where:\n\ngeometry is the given geometry (shapely geometry object)\nvalue is the value to be “burned” into pixels coinciding with the geometry (int or float)\n\nFurthermore, we define how to deal with multiple values burned into the same pixel, using the merge_alg parameter. The default merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.replace means that “later” values replace “earlier” ones, i.e., the pixel gets the “last” burned value. The other option merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.add means that burned values are summed, i.e., the pixel gets the sum of all burned values.\nWhen rasterizing lines and polygons, we also have the choice between two pixel-matching algorithms. The default, all_touched=False, implies pixels that are selected by Bresenham’s line algorithm (for lines) or pixels whose center is within the polygon (for polygons). The other option all_touched=True, as the name suggests, implies that all pixels intersecting with the geometry are matched.\nFinally, we can set the fill value, which is the value that “unaffected” pixels get, with fill=0 being the default.\nHow the rasterio.features.rasterize function works with all of these various parameters will be made clear in the next examples.\nThe geographic resolution of the “template” raster has a major impact on the results: if it is too low (cell size is too large), the result may miss the full geographic variability of the vector data; if it is too high, computational times may be excessive. There are no simple rules to follow when deciding an appropriate geographic resolution, which is heavily dependent on the intended use of the results. Often the target resolution is imposed on the user, for example when the output of rasterization needs to be aligned to an existing raster.\nDepending on the input data, rasterization typically takes one of two forms which we demonstrate next:\n\nin point rasterization (Section 5.4.1), we typically choose how to treat multiple points: either to summarize presence/absence, point count, or summed attribute values (Figure 5.6)\nin line and polygon rasterization (Section 5.4.2), there are typically no such “overlaps” and we simply “burn” attribute values, or fixed values, into pixels coinciding with the given geometries (Figure 5.7)\n\n\n5.4.1 Rasterizing points\nTo demonstrate point rasterization, we will prepare a “template” raster that has the same extent and CRS as the input vector data cycle_hire_osm_projected (a dataset on cycle hire points in London, illustrated in Figure 5.6 (a)) and a spatial resolution of 1000 \\(m\\). To do that, we first take our point layer and transform it to a projected CRS.\n\ncycle_hire_osm_projected = cycle_hire_osm.to_crs(27700)\n\nNext, we calculate the out_shape and transform of the template raster. To calculate the transform, we combine the top-left corner of the cycle_hire_osm_projected bounding box with the required resolution (e.g., 1000 \\(m\\)).\n\nbounds = cycle_hire_osm_projected.total_bounds\nres = 1000\ntransform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=bounds[0], \n    north=bounds[3], \n    xsize=res, \n    ysize=res\n)\ntransform\n\nAffine(1000.0, 0.0, 523038.61452275474,\n       0.0, -1000.0, 184971.40854297992)\n\n\nTo calculate the out_shape, we divide the x-axis and y-axis extent by the resolution, taking the ceiling of the results.\n\nrows = math.ceil((bounds[3] - bounds[1]) / res)\ncols = math.ceil((bounds[2] - bounds[0]) / res)\nshape = (rows, cols)\nshape\n\n(11, 16)\n\n\nFinally, we are ready to rasterize. As mentioned abover, point rasterization can be a very flexible operation: the results depend not only on the nature of the template raster, but also on the the pixel “activation” method, namely the way we deal with multiple points matching the same pixel.\nTo illustrate this flexibility, we will try three different approaches to point rasterization (Figure 5.6 (b)-(d)). First, we create a raster representing the presence or absence of cycle hire points (known as presence/absence rasters). In this case, we transfer the value of 1 to all pixels where at least one point falls in. In the rasterio framework, we use the rasterio.features.rasterize function, which requires an iterable object of geometry,value pairs. In this first example, we transform the point GeoDataFrame into a list of shapely geometries and the (fixed) value of 1, using list comprehension as follows. The first five elements of the list are hereby printed to illustrate its structure.\n\ng = [(g, 1) for g in cycle_hire_osm_projected.geometry]\ng[:5]\n\n[(&lt;POINT (532353.838 182857.655)&gt;, 1),\n (&lt;POINT (529848.35 183337.175)&gt;, 1),\n (&lt;POINT (530635.62 182608.992)&gt;, 1),\n (&lt;POINT (532540.398 182495.756)&gt;, 1),\n (&lt;POINT (530432.094 182906.846)&gt;, 1)]\n\n\nThe list of geometry,value pairs is passed to rasterio.features.rasterize, along with the out_shape and transform which define the raster template. The result ch_raster1 is an ndarray with the burned values of 1 where the pixel coincides with at least one point, and 0 in “unaffected” pixels. Note that merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.replace (the default) is used here, which means that a pixel get 1 when one or more point fall in it, or keeps the original 0 value otherwise.\n\nch_raster1 = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    shapes=g,\n    out_shape=shape, \n    transform=transform\n)\nch_raster1\n\narray([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n       [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n       [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nIn our second variant of point rasterization, we count the number of bike hire stations. To do that, we use the fixed value of 1 (same as in the last example), but this time combined with the merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.add argument. That way, multiple values burned into the same pixel are summed, rather than replaced keeping last (which is the default). The new output, ch_raster2, shows the number of cycle hire points in each grid cell.\n\ng = [(g, 1) for g in cycle_hire_osm_projected.geometry]\nch_raster2 = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    shapes=g,\n    out_shape=shape,\n    transform=transform,\n    merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.add\n)\nch_raster2\n\narray([[ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  3,  3],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  1,  3,  3,  5,  5,  8,  9,  1,  3,  2,  6,  7,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  8,  5,  4, 11, 10, 12,  9, 11,  4,  8,  5,  4,  0],\n       [ 0,  1,  4, 10, 10, 11, 18, 16, 13, 12,  8,  6,  5,  2,  3,  0],\n       [ 3,  3,  9,  3,  5, 14, 10, 15,  9,  9,  5,  8,  0,  0, 12,  2],\n       [ 4,  5,  9, 11,  6,  7,  7,  3, 10,  9,  4,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 4,  0,  7,  8,  8,  4, 11, 10,  7,  3,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  1,  3,  0,  0,  1,  4,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  1,  1,  0,  1,  0,  4,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  1,  0,  5,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]],\n      dtype=uint8)\n\n\nThe cycle hire locations have different numbers of bicycles described by the capacity variable, raising the question, what is the capacity in each grid cell? To calculate that, in our third point rasterization variant we sum the field ('capacity') rather than the fixed values of 1. This requires using a more complex list comprehension expression, where we also (1) extract both geometries and the attribute of interest, and (2) filter out “No Data” values, which can be done as follows. You are invited to run the separate parts to see how this works; the important point is that, in the end, we get the list g with the geometry,value pairs to be burned, only that the value is now variable, rather than fixed, among points.\n\ng = [(g, v) for g, v in cycle_hire_osm_projected[['geometry', 'capacity']] \\\n        .dropna(subset='capacity')\n        .to_numpy() \\\n        .tolist()]\ng[:5]\n\n[(&lt;POINT (532353.838 182857.655)&gt;, 14.0),\n (&lt;POINT (530635.62 182608.992)&gt;, 11.0),\n (&lt;POINT (532620.775 181944.736)&gt;, 20.0),\n (&lt;POINT (527891.578 181374.392)&gt;, 6.0),\n (&lt;POINT (530399.064 181205.925)&gt;, 17.0)]\n\n\nNow we rasterize the points, again using merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.add to sum the capacity values per pixel.\n\nch_raster3 = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    shapes=g,\n    out_shape=shape,\n    transform=transform,\n    merge_alg=rasterio.enums.MergeAlg.add\n)\nch_raster3\n\narray([[  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,  11.,  34.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,  11.,  35.,  24.],\n       [  0.,   0.,   0.,   7.,  30.,  46.,  60.,  73.,  72.,  75.,   6.,\n         50.,  25.,  47.,  36.,   0.],\n       [  0.,   0.,   0.,  89.,  36.,  31., 167.,  97., 115.,  80., 138.,\n         61.,  65., 109.,  43.,   0.],\n       [  0.,  11.,  42., 104., 108., 138., 259., 206., 203., 135., 107.,\n         37.,   0.,  25.,  60.,   0.],\n       [ 88.,  41.,  83.,  28.,  64., 115.,  99., 249., 107., 117.,  60.,\n         33.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,  89., 107.,  95.,  73., 119.,  69.,  23., 140., 141.,  46.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,   0.,  55.,  97., 101.,  59., 119., 109.,  75.,  12.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,  10.,  23.,   0.,   0.,   5.,  41.,   0.,   8.,   0.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,  19.,   9.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,  29.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],\n       [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,\n          0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.]], dtype=float32)\n\n\nThe result ch_raster3 shows the total capacity of cycle hire points in each grid cell.\nThe input point layer cycle_hire_osm_projected and the three variants of rasterizing it ch_raster1, ch_raster2, and ch_raster3 are shown in Figure 5.6.\n# Input points\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ncycle_hire_osm_projected.plot(column='capacity', ax=ax);\n# Presence/Absence\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(ch_raster1, transform=transform, ax=ax);\n# Point counts\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(ch_raster2, transform=transform, ax=ax);\n# Summed attribute values\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(ch_raster3, transform=transform, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Input points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Presence/Absence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Point counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Summed attribute values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Original data and three variants of point rasterization\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Rasterizing lines and polygons\nAnother dataset based on California’s polygons and borders (created below) illustrates rasterization of lines. There are three preliminary steps. First, we subset the California polygon.\n\ncalifornia = us_states[us_states['NAME'] == 'California']\ncalifornia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOID\nNAME\n...\ntotal_pop_15\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n26\n06\nCalifornia\n...\n38421464.0\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-118.60338 33.4...\n\n\n\n\n1 rows × 7 columns\n\n\n\nSecond, we “cast” the polygon into a 'MultiLineString' geometry, using the .boundary property that GeoSeries and DataFrames have.\n\ncalifornia_borders = california.boundary\ncalifornia_borders\n\n26    MULTILINESTRING ((-118.60338 33...\ndtype: geometry\n\n\nThird, we create the transform and shape describing our template raster, with a resolution of a 0.5 degree, using the same approach as in Section 5.4.1.\n\nbounds = california_borders.total_bounds\nres = 0.5\ntransform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=bounds[0], \n    north=bounds[3], \n    xsize=res, \n    ysize=res\n)\nrows = math.ceil((bounds[3] - bounds[1]) / res)\ncols = math.ceil((bounds[2] - bounds[0]) / res)\nshape = (rows, cols)\nshape\n\n(19, 21)\n\n\nFinally, we rasterize california_borders based on the calculated template’s shape and transform. When considering line or polygon rasterization, one useful additional argument is all_touched. By default it is False, but when changed to True—all cells that are touched by a line or polygon border get a value. Line rasterization with all_touched=True is demonstrated in the code below (Figure 5.7, left). We are also using fill=np.nan to set “background” values to “No Data”.\n\ncalifornia_raster1 = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    [(g, 1) for g in california_borders],\n    out_shape=shape,\n    transform=transform,\n    all_touched=True,\n    fill=np.nan\n)\n\nCompare it to a polygon rasterization, with all_touched=False (the default), which selects only raster cells whose centroids are inside the selector polygon, as illustrated in Figure 5.7 (right).\n\ncalifornia_raster2 = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    [(g, 1) for g in california.geometry],\n    out_shape=shape,\n    transform=transform,\n    fill=np.nan\n)\n\nTo illustrate which raster pixels are actually selected as part of rasterization, we also show them as points. This also requires the following code section to calculate the points, which we explain in Section 5.5.\n\nheight = california_raster1.shape[0]\nwidth = california_raster1.shape[1]\ncols, rows = np.meshgrid(np.arange(width), np.arange(height))\nx, y = rasterio.transform.xy(transform, rows, cols)\nx = np.array(x).flatten()\ny = np.array(y).flatten()\nz = california_raster1.flatten()\ngeom = gpd.points_from_xy(x, y, crs=california.crs)\npnt = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data={'value':z}, geometry=geom)\npnt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\nPOINT (-124.15959 41.75952)\n\n\n1\n1.0\nPOINT (-123.65959 41.75952)\n\n\n2\n1.0\nPOINT (-123.15959 41.75952)\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n396\n1.0\nPOINT (-115.15959 32.75952)\n\n\n397\n1.0\nPOINT (-114.65959 32.75952)\n\n\n398\nNaN\nPOINT (-114.15959 32.75952)\n\n\n\n\n399 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7 shows the input vector layer, the rasterization results, and the points pnt.\n# Line rasterization\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(california_raster1, transform=transform, ax=ax, cmap='Set3')\ngpd.GeoSeries(california_borders).plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='darkgrey', linewidth=1)\npnt.plot(ax=ax, color='black', markersize=1);\n# Polygon rasterization\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(california_raster2, transform=transform, ax=ax, cmap='Set3')\ncalifornia.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='darkgrey', linewidth=1)\npnt.plot(ax=ax, color='black', markersize=1);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Line rasterization w/ all_touched=True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Polygon rasterization w/ all_touched=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Examples of line and polygon rasterization",

    "text": "5.5 Spatial vectorization\nSpatial vectorization is the counterpart of rasterization (Section 5.4). It involves converting spatially continuous raster data into spatially discrete vector data such as points, lines or polygons. There are three standard methods to convert a raster to a vector layer, which we cover next:\n\nRaster to polygons (Section 5.5.1)—converting raster cells to rectangular polygons, representing pixel areas\nRaster to points (Section 5.5.2)—converting raster cells to points, representing pixel centroids\nRaster to contours (Section 5.5.3)\n\nLet us demonstrate all three in the given order.\n\n5.5.1 Raster to polygons\nThe rasterio.features.shapes gives access to raster pixels as polygon geometries, along with the associated raster values. The returned object is a generator (see note in Section 3.3.1), yielding geometry,value pairs.\nFor example, the following expression returns a generator named shapes, referring to the pixel polygons.\n\nshapes = rasterio.features.shapes(rasterio.band(src_grain, 1) )\nshapes\n\n&lt;generator object shapes at 0x7f0906c8df10&gt;\n\n\nWe can generate all shapes at once into a list named pol with list(shapes).\n\npol = list(shapes)\n\nEach element in pol is a tuple of length 2, containing the GeoJSON-like dict—representing the polygon geometry and the value of the pixel(s) which comprise the polygon. For example, here is the first element of pol.\n\npol[0]\n\n({'type': 'Polygon',\n  'coordinates': [[(-1.5, 1.5),\n    (-1.5, 1.0),\n    (-1.0, 1.0),\n    (-1.0, 1.5),\n    (-1.5, 1.5)]]},\n 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that, when transforming a raster cell into a polygon, five coordinate pairs need to be kept in memory to represent its geometry (explaining why rasters are often fast compared with vectors!).\n\n\nTo transform the list coming out of rasterio.features.shapes into the familiar GeoDataFrame, we need few more steps of data reshaping. First, we apply the shapely.geometry.shape function to go from a list of GeoJSON-like dicts to a list of shapely geometry objects. The list can then be converted to a GeoSeries (see Section 1.2.6).\n\ngeom = [shapely.geometry.shape(i[0]) for i in pol]\ngeom = gpd.GeoSeries(geom, crs=src_grain.crs)\ngeom\n\n0     POLYGON ((-1.5 1.5, -1.5 1, -1 ...\n1     POLYGON ((-1 1.5, -1 1, -0.5 1,...\n2     POLYGON ((-0.5 1.5, -0.5 1, 0 1...\n                     ...                \n11    POLYGON ((0 -0.5, 0.5 -0.5, 0.5...\n12    POLYGON ((0.5 -1, 0.5 -1.5, 1 -...\n13    POLYGON ((1 -1, 1 -1.5, 1.5 -1....\nLength: 14, dtype: geometry\n\n\nThe values can also be extracted from the rasterio.features.shapes result and turned into a corresponding Series.\n\nvalues = [i[1] for i in pol]\nvalues = pd.Series(values)\nvalues\n\n0     1.0\n1     0.0\n2     1.0\n     ... \n11    2.0\n12    0.0\n13    2.0\nLength: 14, dtype: float64\n\n\nFinally, the two can be combined into a GeoDataFrame, hereby named result.\n\nresult = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'value': values, 'geometry': geom})\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\nPOLYGON ((-1.5 1.5, -1.5 1, -1 ...\n\n\n1\n0.0\nPOLYGON ((-1 1.5, -1 1, -0.5 1,...\n\n\n2\n1.0\nPOLYGON ((-0.5 1.5, -0.5 1, 0 1...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n11\n2.0\nPOLYGON ((0 -0.5, 0.5 -0.5, 0.5...\n\n\n12\n0.0\nPOLYGON ((0.5 -1, 0.5 -1.5, 1 -...\n\n\n13\n2.0\nPOLYGON ((1 -1, 1 -1.5, 1.5 -1....\n\n\n\n\n14 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThe polygon layer result is shown in Figure 5.8.\n\nresult.plot(column='value', edgecolor='black', legend=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: grain.tif converted to a polygon layer\n\n\n\n\n\nAs highlighted using edgecolor='black', neighboring pixels sharing the same raster value are dissolved into larger polygons. The rasterio.features.shapes function unfortunately does not offer a way to avoid this type of dissolving. One suggestion is to add unique values between 0 and 0.9999 to all pixels, convert to polygons, and then get back to the original values using np.floor.\n\n\n5.5.2 Raster to points\nTo transform a raster to points, we can use the rasterio.transform.xy function. As the name suggests, the function accepts row and column indices, and transforms them into x- and y-coordinates (using the raster’s transformation matrix). For example, the coordinates of the top-left pixel can be calculated passing the (row,col) indices of (0,0).\n\nsrc = rasterio.open('output/elev.tif')\nrasterio.transform.xy(src.transform, 0, 0)\n\n(-1.25, 1.25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the coordinates of the top-left pixel ((-1.25, 1.25)), as calculated in the above expression, refer to the pixel centroid. Therefore, they are not identical to the raster origin coordinates ((-1.5,1.5)), as specified in the transformation matrix, which are the coordinates of the top-left edge/corner of the raster (see Figure 5.9).\n\nsrc.transform\n\nAffine(0.5, 0.0, -1.5,\n       0.0, -0.5, 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nTo generalize the above expression to calculate the coordinates of all pixels, we first need to generate a grid of all possible row/column index combinations. This can be done using np.meshgrid, as follows.\n\nheight = src.shape[0]\nwidth = src.shape[1]\ncols, rows = np.meshgrid(np.arange(width), np.arange(height))\n\nWe now have two arrays, rows and cols, matching the shape of elev.tif and containing the corresponding row and column indices.\n\nrows\n\narray([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n       [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n       [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n       [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n       [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]])\n\n\n\ncols\n\narray([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])\n\n\nThese can be passed to rasterio.transform.xy to transform the indices into point coordinates, accordingly stored in lists of arrays x and y.\n\nx, y = rasterio.transform.xy(src.transform, rows, cols)\n\n\nx\n\n[array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25]),\n array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25]),\n array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25]),\n array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25]),\n array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25]),\n array([-1.25, -0.75, -0.25,  0.25,  0.75,  1.25])]\n\n\n\ny\n\n[array([1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25]),\n array([0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75]),\n array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]),\n array([-0.25, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25]),\n array([-0.75, -0.75, -0.75, -0.75, -0.75, -0.75]),\n array([-1.25, -1.25, -1.25, -1.25, -1.25, -1.25])]\n\n\nTypically we want to work with the points in the form of a GeoDataFrame which also holds the attribute(s) value(s) as point attributes. To get there, we can transform the coordinates as well as any attributes to 1-dimensional arrays, and then use methods we are already familiar with (Section 1.2.6) to combine them into a GeoDataFrame.\n\nx = np.array(x).flatten()\ny = np.array(y).flatten()\nz = src.read(1).flatten()\ngeom = gpd.points_from_xy(x, y, crs=src.crs)\npnt = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data={'value':z}, geometry=geom)\npnt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nPOINT (-1.25 1.25)\n\n\n1\n2\nPOINT (-0.75 1.25)\n\n\n2\n3\nPOINT (-0.25 1.25)\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n33\n34\nPOINT (0.25 -1.25)\n\n\n34\n35\nPOINT (0.75 -1.25)\n\n\n35\n36\nPOINT (1.25 -1.25)\n\n\n\n\n36 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThis “high-level” workflow, like many other rasterio-based workflows covered in the book, is a commonly used one but lacking from the package itself. From the user perspective, it may be a good idea to wrap the workflow into a function (e.g., raster_to_points(src), returning a GeoDataFrame), to be re-used whenever we need it.\nFigure 5.9 shows the input raster and the resulting point layer.\n# Input raster\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\npnt.plot(column='value', legend=True, ax=ax)\nrasterio.plot.show(src_elev, ax=ax);\n# Points\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\npnt.plot(column='value', legend=True, edgecolor='black', ax=ax)\nrasterio.plot.show(src_elev, alpha=0, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Input raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Raster and point representation of elev.tif\n\n\n\nNote that “No Data” pixels can be filtered out from the conversion, if necessary (see Section 5.6).\n\n\n5.5.3 Raster to contours\nAnother common type of spatial vectorization is the creation of contour lines, representing lines of continuous height or temperatures (isotherms), for example. We will use a real-world digital elevation model (DEM) because the artificial raster elev.tif produces parallel lines (task for the reader: verify this and explain why this happens). Plotting contour lines is straightforward, using the contour=True option of rasterio.plot.show (Figure 5.10).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_dem, ax=ax)\nrasterio.plot.show(\n    src_dem, \n    ax=ax, \n    contour=True, \n    levels=np.arange(0,1200,50), \n    colors='black'\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Displaying raster contours\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, rasterio does not provide any way of extracting the contour lines in the form of a vector layer, for uses other than plotting.\nThere are two possible workarounds:\n\nUsing gdal_contour on the command line (see below), or through its Python interface osgeo\nWriting a custom function to export contour coordinates generated by, e.g., matplotlib or skimage\n\nWe demonstrate the first approach, using gdal_contour. Although we deviate from the Python-focused approach towards more direct interaction with GDAL, the benefit of gdal_contour is the proven algorithm, customized to spatial data, and with many relevant options. Both the gdal_contour program (along with other GDAL programs) and its osgeo Python wrapper, should already be installed on your system since GDAL is a dependency of rasterio. Using the command line pathway, generating 50 \\(m\\) contours of the dem.tif file can be done as follows.\n\nos.system('gdal_contour -a elev data/dem.tif output/dem_contour.gpkg -i 50.0')\n\nLike all GDAL programs (also see gdaldem example in Section 3.3.4), gdal_contour works with files. Here, the input is the data/dem.tif file and the result is exported to the output/dem_contour.gpkg file.\nTo illustrate the result, let’s read the resulting dem_contour.gpkg layer back into the Python environment. Note that the layer contains an attribute named 'elev' (as specified using -a elev) with the contour elevation values.\n\ncontours1 = gpd.read_file('output/dem_contour.gpkg')\ncontours1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nelev\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n750.0\nLINESTRING (795382.355 8935384....\n\n\n1\n1\n800.0\nLINESTRING (795237.703 8935384....\n\n\n2\n2\n650.0\nLINESTRING (798098.379 8935384....\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n29\n29\n450.0\nLINESTRING (795324.083 8931774....\n\n\n30\n30\n450.0\nLINESTRING (795488.616 8931774....\n\n\n31\n31\n450.0\nLINESTRING (795717.42 8931774.8...\n\n\n\n\n32 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11 shows the input raster and the resulting contour layer.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(src_dem, ax=ax)\ncontours1.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Contours of the dem.tif raster, calculated using the gdal_contour program",

    "text": "5.6 Distance to nearest geometry\nCalculating a raster of distances to the nearest geometry is an example of a “global” raster operation (Section 3.3.6). To demonstrate it, suppose that we need to calculate a raster representing the distance to the nearest coast in New Zealand. This example also wraps many of the concepts introduced in this chapter and in previous chapters, such as raster aggregation (Section 4.3.2), raster conversion to points (Section 5.5.2), and rasterizing points (Section 5.4.1).\nFor the coastline, we will dissolve the New Zealand administrative division polygon layer and “extract” the boundary as a 'MultiLineString' geometry (Figure 5.12). Note that .dissolve(by=None) (Section 2.2.2) calls .union_all on all geometries (i.e., aggregates everything into one group), which is what we want to do here.\n\ncoastline = nz.dissolve().to_crs(src_nz_elev.crs).boundary.iloc[0]\ncoastline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: New Zealand coastline geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a “template” raster, we will aggregate the New Zealand DEM, in the nz_elev.tif file, to 5 times coarser resolution. The code section below follows the aggeregation example in Section 4.3.2.\n\nfactor = 0.2\n# Reading aggregated array\nr = src_nz_elev.read(1,\n    out_shape=(\n        int(src_nz_elev.height * factor),\n        int(src_nz_elev.width * factor)\n        ),\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.average\n)\n# Updating the transform\nnew_transform = src_nz_elev.transform * src_nz_elev.transform.scale(\n    (src_nz_elev.width / r.shape[1]),\n    (src_nz_elev.height / r.shape[0])\n)\n\nThe resulting array r/new_transform and the lines layer coastline are plotted in Figure 5.13. Note that the raster values are average elevations based on \\(5 \\times 5\\) pixels, but this is irrelevant for the subsequent calculation; the raster is going to be used as a template, and all of its values will be replaced with distances to coastline (Figure 5.14).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(r, transform=new_transform, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(coastline).plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Template to calculate distance to nearest geometry (coastlines, in red)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the actual distances, we must convert each pixel to a vector (point) geometry. For this purpose, we use the technique demonstrated in Section 5.5.2, but we’re keeping the points as a list of shapely geometries, rather than a GeoDataFrame, since such a list is sufficient for the subsequent calculation.\n\nheight = r.shape[0]\nwidth = r.shape[1]\ncols, rows = np.meshgrid(np.arange(width), np.arange(height))\nx, y = rasterio.transform.xy(new_transform, rows, cols)\nx = np.array(x).flatten()\ny = np.array(y).flatten()\nz = r.flatten()\nx = x[~np.isnan(z)]\ny = y[~np.isnan(z)]\ngeom = gpd.points_from_xy(x, y, crs=california.crs)\ngeom = list(geom)\ngeom[:5]\n\n[&lt;POINT (1572956.546 6189460.927)&gt;,\n &lt;POINT (1577956.546 6189460.927)&gt;,\n &lt;POINT (1582956.546 6189460.927)&gt;,\n &lt;POINT (1587956.546 6189460.927)&gt;,\n &lt;POINT (1592956.546 6189460.927)&gt;]\n\n\nThe result geom is a list of shapely geometries, representing raster cell centroids (excluding np.nan pixels, which were filtered out).\nNow we can calculate the corresponding list of point geometries and associated distances, using the .distance method from shapely:\n\ndistances = [(i, i.distance(coastline)) for i in geom]\ndistances[0]\n\n(&lt;POINT (1572956.546 6189460.927)&gt;, 826.7523956221047)\n\n\nFinally, we rasterize (see Section 5.4.1) the distances into our raster template.\n\nimage = rasterio.features.rasterize(\n    distances,\n    out_shape=r.shape,\n    dtype=np.float_,\n    transform=new_transform,\n    fill=np.nan\n)\nimage\n\narray([[nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan],\n       ...,\n       [nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan],\n       [nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan]])\n\n\nThe final result, a raster of distances to the nearest coastline, is shown in Figure 5.14.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(image, transform=new_transform, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(coastline).plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Distance to nearest coastline in New Zealand",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nSection 1.4 introduced coordinate reference systems (CRSs), with a focus on the two major types: geographic (‘lon/lat’, with units in degrees longitude and latitude) and projected (typically with units of meters from a datum) coordinate systems. This chapter builds on that knowledge and goes further. It demonstrates how to set and transform geographic data from one CRS to another and, furthermore, highlights specific issues that can arise due to ignoring CRSs that you should be aware of, especially if your data is stored with lon/lat coordinates.\nIt is important to know if your data is in a projected or geographic coordinate system, and the consequences of this for geometry operations. However, if you know the CRS of your data and the consequences for geometry operations (covered in the next section), CRSs should just work behind the scenes: people often suddenly need to learn about CRSs when things go wrong. Having a clearly defined project CRS that all project data is in, plus understanding how and why to use different CRSs, can ensure that things do not go wrong. Furthermore, learning about coordinate systems will deepen your knowledge of geographic datasets and how to use them effectively.\nThis chapter teaches the fundamentals of CRSs, demonstrates the consequences of using different CRSs (including what can go wrong), and how to “reproject” datasets from one coordinate system to another. In the next section we introduce CRSs in Python, followed by Section 6.3 which shows how to get and set CRSs associated with spatial objects. Section 6.4 demonstrates the importance of knowing what CRS your data is in with reference to a worked example of creating buffers. We tackle questions of when to reproject and which CRS to use in Section 6.5 and Section 6.6, respectively. Finally, we cover reprojecting vector and raster objects in Section 6.7 and Section 6.8 and using custom projections in Section 6.9.",

    "section": "6.2 Coordinate Reference Systems",
    "text": "6.2 Coordinate Reference Systems\nMost modern geographic tools that require CRS conversions, including Python packages and desktop GIS software such as QGIS, interface with PROJ, an open source C++ library that “transforms coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another”. CRSs can be described in many ways, including the following:\n\nSimple, yet potentially ambiguous, statements, such as “it’s in lon/lat coordinates”\nFormalized, yet now outdated, ‘proj-strings’, such as +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\nWith an identifying ‘authority:code’ text string, such as EPSG:4326\n\nEach refers to the same thing: the ‘WGS84’ coordinate system that forms the basis of Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and many other datasets. But which one is correct?\nThe short answer is that the third way to identify CRSs is correct: EPSG:4326 is understood by geopandas and rasterio packages covered in this book, plus many other software projects for working with geographic data including QGIS and PROJ. EPSG:4326 is future-proof. Furthermore, although it is machine readable, unlike the proj-string representation EPSG:4326 is short, easy to remember and highly ‘findable’ online (searching for EPSG:4326 yields a dedicated page on the website epsg.io, for example). The more concise identifier 4326 is also understood by geopandas and rasterio.\nThe longer answer is that none of the three descriptions are sufficient, and more detail is needed for unambiguous CRS handling and transformations: due to the complexity of CRSs, it is not possible to capture all relevant information about them in such short text strings. For this reason, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, which also developed the Simple Features specification that the geopandas package implements) developed an open standard format for describing CRSs that is called WKT (Well Known Text). This is detailed in a 100+ page document that “defines the structure and content of a text string implementation of the abstract model for coordinate reference systems described in ISO 19111:2019” (Open Geospatial Consortium 2019). The WKT representation of the WGS84 CRS, which has the identifier EPSG:4326 is as follows.\n\ncrs = pyproj.CRS.from_string('EPSG:4326') # or '.from_epsg(4326)'\nprint(crs.to_wkt(pretty=True))\n\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Horizontal component of 3D system.\"],\n        AREA[\"World.\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\n\nThe output of the command shows how the CRS identifier (also known as a Spatial Reference Identifier or SRID) works: it is simply a look-up, providing a unique identifier associated with a more complete WKT representation of the CRS. This raises the question: what happens if there is a mismatch between the identifier and the longer WKT representation of a CRS? On this point Open Geospatial Consortium (Open Geospatial Consortium 2019) is clear, the verbose WKT representation takes precedence over the identifier:\n\nShould any attributes or values given in the cited identifier be in conflict with attributes or values given explicitly in the WKT description, the WKT values shall prevail.\n\nThe convention of referring to CRSs identifiers in the form AUTHORITY:CODE allows a wide range of formally defined coordinate systems to be referred to. The most commonly used authority in CRS identifiers is EPSG, an acronym for the European Petroleum Survey Group which published a standardized list of CRSs. Other authorities can be used in CRS identifiers. ESRI:54030, for example, refers to ESRI’s implementation of the Robinson projection, which has the following WKT string.\n\ncrs = pyproj.CRS.from_string('ESRI:54030')\nprint(crs.to_wkt(pretty=True))\n\nPROJCRS[\"World_Robinson\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"World_Robinson\",\n        METHOD[\"Robinson\"],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",0,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",0,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Not known.\"],\n        AREA[\"World.\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"ESRI\",54030]]\n\n\nWKT strings are exhaustive, detailed, and precise, allowing for unambiguous CRSs storage and transformations. They contain all relevant information about any given CRS, including its datum and ellipsoid, prime meridian, projection, and units.\nRecent PROJ versions (6+) still allow use of proj-strings to define coordinate operations, but some proj-string keys (+nadgrids, +towgs84, +k, +init=epsg:) are either no longer supported or are discouraged. Additionally, only three datums (i.e., WGS84, NAD83, and NAD27) can be directly set in proj-string. Longer explanations of the evolution of CRS definitions and the PROJ library can be found in (Bivand 2021), Chapter 2 of (Pebesma and Bivand 2022), and a blog post by Floris Vanderhaeghe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs outlined in the PROJ documentation, there are different versions of the WKT CRS format including WKT1 and two variants of WKT2, the latter of which (WKT2, 2018 specification) corresponds to the ISO 19111:2019 (Open Geospatial Consortium 2019).",

    "text": "6.3 Querying and setting coordinate systems\nLet’s see how CRSs are stored in Python spatial objects and how they can be queried and set. First we will look at getting and setting CRSs in vector geographic data objects. Consider the GeoDataFrame object named world, imported from a file world.gpkg that represents countries worldwide. Its CRS can be retrieved using the .crs property.\n\nworld.crs\n\n&lt;Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4326&gt;\nName: WGS 84\nAxis Info [ellipsoidal]:\n- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)\n- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)\nArea of Use:\n- name: World.\n- bounds: (-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0)\nDatum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\n- Ellipsoid: WGS 84\n- Prime Meridian: Greenwich\n\n\nThe output specifies the following pieces of information:\n\nThe CRS type (Geographic 2D CRS) and SRID code (EPSG:4326)\nThe CRS name (WGS 84)\nThe axes (latitude, longitude) and their units (degree)\nThe applicable area name (World) and bounding box ((-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0))\nThe datum (WGS 84)\n\nThe WKT representation, which is internally used when saving the object to a file or doing any coordinate operations, can be extracted using .crs.to_wkt() as shown above (Section 6.2). We can also see that the world object has the WGS84 ellipsoid, the latitude and longitude axis order, and uses the Greenwich prime meridian. We also have the suitable suitable area specification for the use of this CRS, and CRS identifier: EPSG:4326.\nThe CRS specification object, such as world.crs, has several useful properties and methods to explicitly retrieve information about the used CRS. For example, we can check whether the CRS is geographic with the .is_geographic property.\n\nworld.crs.is_geographic\n\nTrue\n\n\nCRS units of both axes (typically identical) can be retrieved with the .axis_info property.\n\nworld.crs.axis_info[0].unit_name, world.crs.axis_info[1].unit_name\n\n('degree', 'degree')\n\n\nAUTHORITY and CODE strings may be obtained with the .to_authority() method.\n\nworld.crs.to_authority()\n\n('EPSG', '4326')\n\n\nIn cases when a coordinate reference system (CRS) is missing or the wrong CRS is set, the .set_crs method can be used on a GeoSeries or a GeoDataFrame to set it. The CRS can be specified using an EPSG code as the first argument. In case the object already has a different CRS definition, we must also specify allow_override=True to replace it (otherwise we get an error). In the first example we set the EPSG:4326 CRS, which has no effect because world already has that exact CRS definition, while the second example replaces the existing CRS with a new definition of EPSG:3857.\n\nworld2 = world.set_crs(4326)\nworld3 = world.set_crs(3857, allow_override=True)\n\nThe provided number is interpreted as an EPSG code. We can also use strings, as in 'EPSG:4326', which is useful to make the code more clear and when using other authorities than EPSG.\n\nworld4 = world.set_crs('ESRI:54009', allow_override=True)\n\nIn rasterio, the CRS information is stored as part of a raster file connection metadata (Section 1.3.1). Replacing the CRS definition for a rasterio file connection is typically not necessary, because it is not considered in any operation; only the transformation matrix and coordinates are. One exception is when writing the raster, in which case we need to construct the metadata of the raster file to be written, and therein specify the CRS anyway (Section 1.3.2). However, if we, for some reason, need to change the CRS definition in the file connection metadata, we can do that when opening the file in r+ (reading and writing) mode. To demonstrate, we will create a copy of the nlcd.tif file, named nlcd2.tif,\n\nshutil.copy('data/nlcd.tif', 'output/nlcd_modified_crs.tif')\n\n'output/nlcd_modified_crs.tif'\n\n\nand examine its existing CRS.\n\nsrc_nlcd2 = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_modified_crs.tif', 'r+')\nsrc_nlcd2.crs\n\nCRS.from_epsg(26912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe rasterio.open function modes generally follows Python’s standard file connection modes, with possible arguments being 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'r+' (read/write), and 'w+' (write/read) (the 'a' “append” mode is irrelevant for raster files). In the book, and in general, the most commonly used modes are 'r' (read) and 'w' (write). 'r+', used in the last example, means ‘read/write’. Unlike with 'w', 'r+' does not delete the existing content on open, making 'r+' suitable for making changes in an existing file (such as here, replacing the CRS).\n\n\nTo replace the definition with a new one, such as EPSG:3857, we can use the .crs method, as shown below.\n\nsrc_nlcd2.crs = 3857\nsrc_nlcd2.close()\n\nNext, examining the file connection demonstrates that the CRS was indeed changed.\n\nrasterio.open('output/nlcd_modified_crs.tif').crs\n\nCRS.from_epsg(3857)\n\n\nImportantly, the .set_crs (for vector layers) or the assignment to .crs (for rasters), as shown above, do not alter coordinates’ values or geometries. Their role is only to set a metadata information about the object CRS. Consequently, the objects we created, world3, world4, and src_nlcd2 are “incorrect”, in the sense that the geometries are in fact given in a different CRS than specified in the associated CRS definition.\nIn some cases, the CRS of a geographic object is unknown, as is the case in the London dataset created in the code chunk below, building on the example of London introduced in Section 1.2.6.\n\nlnd_point = shapely.Point(-0.1, 51.5)\nlnd_geom = gpd.GeoSeries([lnd_point])\nlnd_layer = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': lnd_geom})\nlnd_layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-0.1 51.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuerying the .crs of such a layer returns None, therefore nothing is printed.\n\nlnd_layer.crs\n\nThis implies that geopandas does not know what the CRS is and is unwilling to guess. Unless a CRS is manually specified or is loaded from a source that has CRS metadata, geopandas does not make any explicit assumptions about which coordinate systems, other than to say “I don’t know”. This behavior makes sense given the diversity of available CRSs but differs from some approaches, such as the GeoJSON file format specification, which makes the simplifying assumption that all coordinates have a lon/lat CRS: EPSG:4326.\nA CRS can be added to GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame objects using the .set_crs method, as mentioned above.\n\nlnd_layer = lnd_layer.set_crs(4326)\n\nWhen working with geopandas and rasterio, datasets without a specified CRS are not an issue in most workflows, since only the coordinates are considered. It is up to the user to make sure that, when working with more than one layer, all of the coordinates are given in the same CRS (whether specified or not). When exporting the results, though, it is important to keep the CRS definition in place, because other software typically do use, and require, the CRS definition in calculation. It should also be mentioned that, in some cases the CRS specification is left unspecified on purpose, for example when working with layers in arbitrary or non-geographic space (simulations, internal building plans, analysis of plot-scale ecological patterns, etc.).",

    "text": "6.5 When to reproject?\nThe previous section showed how to set the CRS manually, with an expression such as lnd_layer.set_crs(4326). In real world applications, however, CRSs are usually set automatically when data is read-in. Thus, in many projects the main CRS-related task is to transform objects, from one CRS into another. But when should data be transformed? And into which CRS? There are no clear-cut answers to these questions and CRS selection always involves trade-offs (Maling 1992). However, there are some general principles provided in this section that can help you decide.\nFirst, it’s worth considering when to transform. In some cases transformation to a geographic CRS is essential, such as when publishing data online (for example, a Leaflet-based map using Python package folium). Another case is when two objects with different CRSs must be compared or combined, as shown when we try to find the distance between two objects with different CRSs.\n\nlnd_layer.distance(lnd_layer_proj)\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_403/2145313019.py:1: UserWarning: Geometry is in a geographic CRS.

But which CRS to use? The answer depends on context: many projects, especially those involving web mapping, require outputs in EPSG:4326, in which case it is worth transforming the projected object. If, however, the project requires geometric calculations, implying planar geometry, e.g., calculating buffers (Section 6.4), it is necessary to transform data with a geographic CRS into an equivalent object with a projected CRS, such as the British National Grid (EPSG:27700). That is the subject of Section 6.6.",

    "section": "6.6 Which CRS to use?",
    "text": "6.6 Which CRS to use?\nThe question of which CRS is tricky, and there is rarely a “right” answer: “There exist no all-purpose projections, all involve distortion when far from the center of the specified frame” (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). Additionally, you should not be attached just to one projection for every task. It is possible to use one projection for some part of the analysis, another projection for a different part, and even some other for visualization. Always try to pick the CRS that serves your goal best!\nWhen selecting geographic CRSs, the answer is often WGS84. It is used not only for web mapping, but also because GPS datasets and thousands of raster and vector datasets are provided in this CRS by default. WGS84 is the most common CRS in the world, so it is worth knowing its EPSG code: 4326. This “magic number” can be used to convert objects with unusual projected CRSs into something that is widely understood.\nWhat about when a projected CRS is required? In some cases, it is not something that we are free to decide: “often the choice of projection is made by a public mapping agency” (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). This means that when working with local data sources, it is likely preferable to work with the CRS in which the data was provided, to ensure compatibility, even if the official CRS is not the most accurate. The example of London was easy to answer because the British National Grid (with its associated EPSG code 27700) is well known, and the original dataset (lnd_layer) already had that CRS.\nA commonly used default is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), a set of CRSs that divides the Earth into 60 longitudinal wedges and 20 latitudinal segments. The transverse Mercator projection used by UTM CRSs is conformal but distorts areas and distances with increasing severity with distance from the center of the UTM zone. Documentation from the GIS software Manifold therefore suggests restricting the longitudinal extent of projects using UTM zones to 6 degrees from the central meridian (source: manifold.net). Therefore, we recommend using UTM only when your focus is on preserving angles for a relatively small area!\nAlmost every place on Earth has a UTM code, such as '60H' which refers, amoung others, to northern New Zealand. UTM EPSG codes run sequentially from 32601 to 32660 for northern hemisphere locations and from 32701 to 32760 for southern hemisphere locations.\nTo show how the system works, let’s create a function, lonlat2UTM to calculate the EPSG code associated with any point on the planet.\n\ndef lonlat2UTM(lon, lat):\n    utm = (math.floor((lon + 180) / 6) % 60) + 1\n    if lat &gt; 0:\n        utm += 32600\n    else:\n        utm += 32700\n    return utm\n\nThe following command uses this function to identify the UTM zone and associated EPSG code for Auckland.\n\nlonlat2UTM(174.7, -36.9)\n\n32760\n\n\nHere is another example for London (where we “unpack” the coordinates of the 1st geometry in lnd_layer into the lonlat2UTM function arguments).\n\nlonlat2UTM(*lnd_layer.geometry.iloc[0].coords[0])\n\n32630\n\n\nCurrently, we also have tools helping us to select a proper CRS. For example, the webpage https://crs-explorer.proj.org/ lists CRSs based on selected location and type. Important note: while these tools are helpful in many situations, you need to be aware of the properties of the recommended CRS before you apply it.\nIn cases where an appropriate CRS is not immediately clear, the choice of CRS should depend on the properties that are most important to preserve in the subsequent maps and analysis. All CRSs are either equal-area, equidistant, conformal (with shapes remaining unchanged), or some combination of compromises of those (Section 1.4.2). Custom CRSs with local parameters can be created for a region of interest and multiple CRSs can be used in projects when no single CRS suits all tasks. “Geodesic calculations” can provide a fall-back if no CRSs are appropriate (see https://proj.org/geodesic.html). Regardless of the projected CRS used, the results may not be accurate for geometries covering hundreds of kilometers.\nWhen deciding on a custom CRS, we recommend the following:\n\nA Lambert azimuthal equal-area (LAEA) projection for a custom local projection (set latitude and longitude of origin to the center of the study area), which is an equal-area projection at all locations but distorts shapes beyond thousands of kilometers\nAzimuthal equidistant (AEQD) projections for a specifically accurate straight-line distance between a point and the center point of the local projection\nLambert conformal conic (LCC) projections for regions covering thousands of kilometers, with the cone set to keep distance and area properties reasonable between the secant lines\nStereographic (STERE) projections for polar regions, but taking care not to rely on area and distance calculations thousands of kilometers from the center\n\nOne possible approach to automatically select a projected CRS specific to a local dataset is to create an azimuthal equidistant (AEQD) projection for the center-point of the study area. This involves creating a custom CRS (with no EPSG code) with units of meters based on the center point of a dataset. Note that this approach should be used with caution: no other datasets will be compatible with the custom CRS created and results may not be accurate when used on extensive datasets covering hundreds of kilometers.\nThe principles outlined in this section apply equally to vector and raster datasets. Some features of CRS transformation however are unique to each geographic data model. We will cover the particularities of vector data transformation in Section 6.7 and those of raster transformation in Section 6.8. The last section, Section 6.9, shows how to create custom map projections.",

Reprojecting vectors thus consists of transforming the coordinates of these points, which form the vertices of lines and polygons.\nSection 6.4 contains an example in which at a GeoDataFrame had to be transformed into an equivalent object, with a different CRS, to calculate the distance between two objects. Reprojection of vector layers is done using the .to_crs method.\n\nlnd_layer2 = lnd_layer.to_crs(27700)\n\nNow that a transformed version of lnd_layer has been created, the distance between the two representations of London can be found using the .distance method.\n\nlnd_layer2.distance(lnd_layer_proj)\n\n0    2017.949587\ndtype: float64\n\n\nIt may come as a surprise that lnd_layer and lnd_layer2 are just over 2 \\(km\\) apart!

    "text": "6.8 Reprojecting raster geometries\nThe CRSs concepts described in the previous section apply equally to rasters. However, there are important differences in reprojection of vectors and rasters: transforming a vector object involves changing the coordinates of every vertex, but this does not apply to raster data. Rasters are composed of rectangular cells of the same size (expressed by map units, such as degrees or meters), so it is usually impracticable to transform coordinates of pixels separately. Raster reprojection involves creating a new raster object in the destination CRS, often with a different number of columns and rows than the original. The attributes must subsequently be re-estimated, allowing the new pixels to be “filled” with appropriate values. In other words, raster reprojection can be thought of as two separate spatial operations: a vector reprojection of the raster extent to another CRS (Section 6.7), and computation of new pixel values through resampling (Section 4.3.3). Due to this additional complexity, in most cases when both raster and vector data are used, it is better to avoid reprojecting rasters and reproject vectors instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReprojection of the regular rasters is also known as warping. Additionally, there is a second similar operation called “transformation”. Instead of resampling all of the values, it leaves all values intact but recomputes new coordinates for every raster cell, changing the grid geometry. For example, it could convert the input raster (a regular grid) into a curvilinear grid. The rasterio, like common raster file formats (such as GeoTIFF), does not support curvilinear grids. The xarray package, for instance, can be used to work with curvilinear grids.\n\n\nThe raster reprojection process is done using two functions from the rasterio.warp sub-package:\n\nrasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform, used to calculate the new transformation matrix in the destination CRS, according to the source raster dimensions and bounds. Alternatively, the destination transformation matrix can be obtained from an existing raster; this is common practice when we need to align one raster with another, for instance to be able to combine them in raster algebra operations (Section 3.3.3) (see below)\nrasterio.warp.reproject, introduced in Section 4.3.3, calculates cell values in the destination grid, using the user-selected resampling method (such as nearest neighbor, or bilinear)\n\nLet’s take a look at two examples of raster transformation: using categorical and continuous data. Land cover data are usually represented by categorical maps. The nlcd.tif file provides information for a small area in Utah, USA obtained from National Land Cover Database 2011 in the NAD83 / UTM zone 12N CRS. We already created a connection to the nlcd.tif file at the beginning of this chapter, named src_nlcd.\n\nsrc_nlcd\n\n&lt;open DatasetReader name='data/nlcd.tif' mode='r'&gt;\n\n\nRecall from previous chapters that the raster transformation matrix and dimensions are accessible from the file connection using src_nlcd.transform, src_nlcd.width, and src_nlcd.height, respectively. \nThis information will be required to calculate the destination transformation matrix.\nFirst, let’s define the destination CRS. In this case, we choose WGS84 (EPSG code 4326).\n\ndst_crs = 'EPSG:4326'\n\nNow, we are ready to calculate the destination raster transformation matrix (dst_transform), and the destination dimensions (dst_width, dst_height), using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform, as follows:\n\ndst_transform, dst_width, dst_height = rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform(\n    src_nlcd.crs,\n    dst_crs,\n    src_nlcd.width,\n    src_nlcd.height,\n    *src_nlcd.bounds\n)\n\nHere is the result.\n\ndst_transform\n\nAffine(0.00031506316853514724, 0.0, -113.24138811813536,\n       0.0, -0.00031506316853514724, 37.51912722777022)\n\n\n\ndst_width\n\n1244\n\n\n\ndst_height\n\n1246\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe * syntax in Python is known as variable-length “positional arguments”. It is used to pass a list or tuple (or other iterables object) to positional arguments of a function.\nFor example, in the last code block, *, in *src_nlcd.bounds, is used to unpack src_nlcd.bounds (an iterable of length 4) to four separate arguments (left, bottom, right, and top), which rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform requires in that order. In other words, the expression from the last example:\nrasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform(\n    src_nlcd.crs,\n    dst_crs,\n    src_nlcd.width,\n    src_nlcd.height,\n    *src_nlcd.bounds\n)\nis a shortcut of:\nrasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform(\n    src_nlcd.crs,\n    dst_crs,\n    src_nlcd.width,\n    src_nlcd.height,\n    src_nlcd.bounds[0],\n    src_nlcd.bounds[1],\n    src_nlcd.bounds[2],\n    src_nlcd.bounds[3]\n)\n“Keyword arguments” is a related technique; see note in Section 4.3.2.\n\n\nRecall from Section 4.3.3 that resampling using rasterio.warp.reproject can take place directly into a “destination” raster file connection. Therefore, our next step is to create the metadata file used for writing the reprojected raster to file. For convenience, we are taking the metadata of the source raster (src_nlcd.meta), making a copy (dst_kwargs), and then updating those specific properties that need to be changed. Note that the reprojection process typically creates “No Data” pixels, even when there were none in the input raster, since the raster orientation changes and the edges need to be “filled” to get back a rectangular extent. For example, a reprojected raster may appear as a “tilted” rectangle, inside a larger straight rectangular extent, whereas the margins around the tilted rectangle are inevitably filled with “No Data” (e.g., the white stripes surrounding the edges in Figure 6.2 (b) are “No Data” pixels created as a result of reprojection). We need to specify a “No Data” value of our choice, if there is no existing definition, or keep the existing source raster “No Data” setting, such as 255 in this case.\n\ndst_kwargs = src_nlcd.meta.copy()\ndst_kwargs.update({\n    'crs': dst_crs,\n    'transform': dst_transform,\n    'width': dst_width,\n    'height': dst_height\n})\ndst_kwargs\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint8',\n 'nodata': 255.0,\n 'width': 1244,\n 'height': 1246,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': 'EPSG:4326',\n 'transform': Affine(0.00031506316853514724, 0.0, -113.24138811813536,\n        0.0, -0.00031506316853514724, 37.51912722777022)}\n\n\nNow, we are ready to create the reprojected raster. Here, reprojection takes place between two file connections, meaning that the raster value arrays are not being read into memory at once. It is also possible to reproject into an in-memory ndarray object, see the documentation.\nTo write the reprojected raster, we first create a destination file connection dst_nlcd, pointing at the output file path of our choice ('output/nlcd_4326.tif'), using the updated metadata object created earlier (dst_kwargs):\n\ndst_nlcd = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\n\nThen, we use the rasterio.warp.reproject function to calculate and write the reprojection result into the dst_nlcd file connection.\n\nrasterio.warp.reproject(\n    source=rasterio.band(src_nlcd, 1),\n    destination=rasterio.band(dst_nlcd, 1),\n    src_transform=src_nlcd.transform,\n    src_crs=src_nlcd.crs,\n    dst_transform=dst_transform,\n    dst_crs=dst_crs,\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest\n)\n\nNote–like in the example in Section 4.3.3—that the source and destination accept a “band” object, created using rasterio.band. In this case, there is just one band. If there were more bands, we would have to repeat the procedure for each band, using i instead of 1 inside a loop. Finally, we close the file connection so that the data are actually written.\n\ndst_nlcd.close()\n\nMany properties of the new object differ from the previous one, including the number of columns and rows (and therefore number of cells), resolution (transformed from meters into degrees), and extent, as summarized below by comparing the .meta object of the source and destination rasters.\n\nsrc_nlcd.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint8',\n 'nodata': 255.0,\n 'width': 1073,\n 'height': 1359,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(26912),\n 'transform': Affine(31.530298224786595, 0.0, 301903.344386758,\n        0.0, -31.52465870178793, 4154086.47216415)}\n\n\n\nsrc_nlcd_4326 = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326.tif')\nsrc_nlcd_4326.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint8',\n 'nodata': 255.0,\n 'width': 1244,\n 'height': 1246,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.00031506316853514724, 0.0, -113.24138811813536,\n        0.0, -0.00031506316853514724, 37.51912722777022)}\n\n\nExamining the unique raster values tells us that the new raster has the same categories, plus the value 255 representing “No Data”:\n\nnp.unique(src_nlcd.read(1))\n\narray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=uint8)\n\n\n\nnp.unique(src_nlcd_4326.read(1))\n\narray([  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8, 255], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nFigure 6.2 illustrates the effect of reprojection, comparing nlcd.tif (the input) and nlcd_4326.tif (the reprojection result), visually.\nrasterio.plot.show(src_nlcd, cmap='Set3');\nrasterio.plot.show(src_nlcd_4326, cmap='Set3');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original (EPSG:26912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reprojected (EPSG:4326)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Reprojecting a categorical raster using nearest neighbor resampling\n\n\n\nIn the above example, we automatically calculated an optimal (i.e., most information preserving) destination grid using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform. This is appropriate when there are no specific requirements for the destination raster spatial properties. Namely, we are not required to obtain a specific origin and resolution, but just wish to preserve the raster values as much as possible. To do that, rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform “tries” to keep the extent and resolution of the destination raster as similar as possible to the source. In other situations, however, we need to reproject a raster into a specific “template”, so that it corresponds, for instance, with other rasters we use in the analysis. In the following code examples, we reproject the nlcd.tif raster, again, but this time using the nlcd_4326.tif reprojection result as the “template” to demonstrate this alternative workflow.\nFirst, we create a connection to our “template” raster to read its metadata.\n\ntemplate = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326.tif')\ntemplate.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint8',\n 'nodata': 255.0,\n 'width': 1244,\n 'height': 1246,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.00031506316853514724, 0.0, -113.24138811813536,\n        0.0, -0.00031506316853514724, 37.51912722777022)}\n\n\nThen, we create a write-mode connection to our destination raster, using this exact metadata, meaning that the resampling result is going to have identical properties as the “template”.\n\ndst_nlcd_2 = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326_2.tif', 'w', **template.meta)\n\nNow, we can resample and write the result with rasterio.warp.reproject.\n\nrasterio.warp.reproject(\n    source=rasterio.band(src_nlcd, 1),\n    destination=rasterio.band(dst_nlcd_2, 1),\n    src_transform=src_nlcd.transform,\n    src_crs=src_nlcd.crs,\n    dst_transform=dst_nlcd_2.transform,\n    dst_crs=dst_nlcd_2.crs,\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest\n)\ndst_nlcd_2.close()\n\nNaturally, the outputs of the last two examples—nlcd_4326.tif and nlcd_4326_2.tif—are identical, as we used the same destination grid and the same source data. We can check it with np.all.\n\nd = rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326.tif').read(1) == \\\n    rasterio.open('output/nlcd_4326_2.tif').read(1)\nnp.all(d)\n\nTrue\n\n\nThe difference is that in the first example we calculated the template automatically, using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform, while in the second example we used an existing raster as the “template”.\nImportantly, when the template raster has much more “coarse” resolution than the source raster, the rasterio.enums.Resampling.average (for continuous rasters) or rasterio.enums.Resampling.mode (for categorical rasters) resampling methods should be used, instead of rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest. Otherwise, much of the data will be lost, as the “nearest” method can capture one pixel value only for each destination raster pixel.\nReprojecting continuous rasters (with numeric or, in this case, integer values) follows an almost identical procedure. This is demonstrated below with srtm.tif from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which represents height in meters above sea level (elevation) with the WGS84 CRS.\nWe will reproject this dataset into a projected CRS, but not with the nearest neighbor method. Instead, we will use the bilinear method which computes the output cell value based on the four nearest cells in the original raster. The values in the projected dataset are the distance-weighted average of the values from these four cells: the closer the input cell is to the center of the output cell, the greater its weight. The following code section creates a text string representing WGS 84 / UTM zone 12N, and reprojects the raster into this CRS, using the bilinear method. The code is practically the same as in the first example in this section, except for changing the source and destination file names, and replacing rasterio.enums.Resampling.nearest with rasterio.enums.Resampling.bilinear.\n\ndst_crs = 'EPSG:32612'\ndst_transform, dst_width, dst_height = rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform(\n    src_srtm.crs,\n    dst_crs,\n    src_srtm.width,\n    src_srtm.height,\n    *src_srtm.bounds\n)\ndst_kwargs = src_srtm.meta.copy()\ndst_kwargs.update({\n    'crs': dst_crs,\n    'transform': dst_transform,\n    'width': dst_width,\n    'height': dst_height\n})\ndst_srtm = rasterio.open('output/srtm_32612.tif', 'w', **dst_kwargs)\nrasterio.warp.reproject(\n    source=rasterio.band(src_srtm, 1),\n    destination=rasterio.band(dst_srtm, 1),\n    src_transform=src_srtm.transform,\n    src_crs=src_srtm.crs,\n    dst_transform=dst_transform,\n    dst_crs=dst_crs,\n    resampling=rasterio.enums.Resampling.bilinear\n)\ndst_srtm.close()\n\nFigure 6.3 shows the input and the reprojected SRTM rasters.\nrasterio.plot.show(src_srtm);\nrasterio.plot.show(rasterio.open('output/srtm_32612.tif'));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original (EPSG:4326)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reprojected (EPSG:32612)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Reprojecting a continuous raster using bilinear resampling",

    "section": "6.9 Custom map projections",
    "text": "6.9 Custom map projections\nEstablished CRSs captured by AUTHORITY:CODE identifiers such as EPSG:4326 are well suited for many applications. However, it is desirable to use alternative projections or to create custom CRSs in some cases. Section 6.6 mentioned reasons for using custom CRSs, and provided several possible approaches. Here, we show how to apply these ideas in Python.\nOne approach is to take an existing WKT definition of a CRS, modify some of its elements, and then use the new definition for reprojecting, using the reprojection methods shown above for vector layers (Section 6.7) and rasters (Section 6.8). For example, let’s transforms the zion.gpkg vector layer to a custom azimuthal equidistant (AEQD) CRS. Using a custom AEQD CRS requires knowing the coordinates of the center point of a dataset in degrees (geographic CRS). In our case, this information can be extracted by calculating the centroid of the zion layer transformed into WGS84:\n\nlon, lat = zion.to_crs(4326).union_all().centroid.coords[0]\nlon, lat\n\n(-113.02644198455545, 37.29823698523389)\n\n\nNext, we can use the obtained lon/lat coordinates in coords to update the WKT definition of the azimuthal equidistant (AEQD) CRS seen below. Notice that we modified just two values below—\"Central_Meridian\" to the longitude and \"Latitude_Of_Origin\" to the latitude of our centroid.\n\nmy_wkt = f'''PROJCS[\"Custom_AEQD\",\n GEOGCS[\"GCS_WGS_1984\",\n  DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",\n   SPHEROID[\"WGS_1984\",6378137.0,298.257223563]],\n  PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],\n  UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n PROJECTION[\"Azimuthal_Equidistant\"],\n PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",{lon}],\n PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",{lat}],\n UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0]]'''\nprint(my_wkt)\n\nPROJCS[\"Custom_AEQD\",\n GEOGCS[\"GCS_WGS_1984\",\n  DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",\n   SPHEROID[\"WGS_1984\",6378137.0,298.257223563]],\n  PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],\n  UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n PROJECTION[\"Azimuthal_Equidistant\"],\n PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",-113.02644198455545],\n PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",37.29823698523389],\n UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above expression uses the so-called “f-strings” syntax, which is one of several Python techniques to embed values inside a string (as alternatives to concatenating with +). For example, given:\nx = 5\nthe expression:\nf'the value of x is {x}'\nis a shortcut to:\n'the value of x is ' + str(x)\nboth returning the string 'the value of x is 5'.\n\n\nThis approach’s last step is to transform our original object (zion) to our new custom CRS (zion_aeqd).\n\nzion_aeqd = zion.to_crs(my_wkt)\n\nCustom projections can also be made interactively, for example, using the Projection Wizard web application (Šavrič, Jenny, and Jenny 2016). This website allows you to select a spatial extent of your data and a distortion property, and returns a list of possible projections. The list also contains WKT definitions of the projections that you can copy and use for reprojections. See Open Geospatial Consortium (2019) for details on creating custom CRS definitions with WKT strings.\nPROJ strings can also be used to create custom projections, accepting the limitations inherent to projections, especially of geometries covering large geographic areas, as mentioned in Section 6.2. Many projections have been developed and can be set with the +proj= element of PROJ strings, with dozens of projections described in detail on the PROJ website alone.\nWhen mapping the world while preserving area relationships, the Mollweide projection, illustrated in Figure 6.4, is a popular and often sensible choice (Jenny et al. 2017). To use this projection, we need to specify it using the proj-string element, '+proj=moll', in the .to_crs method:\n\nworld.to_crs('+proj=moll').plot(color='none', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Mollweide projection of the world\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is often desirable to minimize distortion for all spatial properties (area, direction, distance) when mapping the world. One of the most popular projections to achieve this is Winkel tripel ('+proj=wintri'), illustrated in Figure 6.5.\n\nworld.to_crs('+proj=wintri').plot(color='none', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Winkel tripel projection of the world\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, proj-string parameters can be modified in most CRS definitions, for example the center of the projection can be adjusted using the +lon_0 and +lat_0 parameters. The below code transforms the coordinates to the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection centered on the longitude and latitude of New York City (Figure 6.6).\n\nworld.to_crs('+proj=laea +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +lon_0=-74 +lat_0=40') \\\n    .plot(color='none', edgecolor='black');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection of the world centered on New York City\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information on CRS modifications can be found in the Using PROJ documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBivand, Roger. 2021. “Progress in the R Ecosystem for Representing and Handling Spatial Data.” Journal of Geographical Systems 23 (4): 515–46. https://doi.org/ghnwg3.\n\n\nBivand, Roger, Edzer Pebesma, and Virgilio Gómez-Rubio. 2013.

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nThis chapter is about reading and writing geographic data. Geographic data input is essential for geocomputation: real-world applications are impossible without data. Data output is also vital, enabling others to use valuable new or improved datasets resulting from your work. Taken together, these processes of input/output can be referred to as data I/O.\nGeographic data I/O is often done with few lines of code at the beginning and end of projects. It is often overlooked as a simple one step process. However, mistakes made at the outset of projects (e.g., using an out-of-date or in some way faulty dataset) can lead to large problems later down the line, so it is worth putting considerable time into identifying which datasets are available, where they can be found and how to retrieve them. These topics are covered in Section 7.2, which describes various geoportals, which collectively contain many terabytes of data, and how to use them. To further ease data access, a number of packages for downloading geographic data have been developed, as described in Section 7.3.\nThere are many geographic file formats, each of which has pros and cons, described in Section 7.4. The process of reading and writing files efficiently is covered in Sections Section 7.5 and Section 7.6, respectively.",

    "text": "7.2 Retrieving open data\nA vast and ever-increasing amount of geographic data is available on the internet, much of which is free to access and use (with appropriate credit given to its providers).1 In some ways there is now too much data, in the sense that there are often multiple places to access the same dataset. Some datasets are of poor quality. In this context, it is vital to know where to look, so the first section covers some of the most important sources. Various ‘geoportals’ (web services providing geospatial datasets such as Data.gov) are a good place to start, providing a wide range of data but often only for specific locations (as illustrated in the updated Wikipedia page on the topic).\nSome global geoportals overcome this issue. The GEOSS portal and the Copernicus Open Access Hub, for example, contain many raster datasets with global coverage. A wealth of vector datasets can be accessed from the SEDAC portal run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Union’s INSPIRE geoportal, with global and regional coverage.\nMost geoportals provide a graphical interface allowing datasets to be queried based on characteristics such as spatial and temporal extent, the United States Geological Survey’s EarthExplorer being a prime example. Exploring datasets interactively on a browser is an effective way of understanding available layers. From reproducibility and efficiency perspectives, downloading data is, however, best done with code. Downloads can be initiated from the command line using a variety of techniques, primarily via URLs and APIs (see the Sentinel API, for example). Files hosted on static URLs can be downloaded with the following method, as illustrated in the code chunk below which accesses the Natural Earth Data website to download the world airports layer zip file and to extract the contained ESRI Shapefile. Note that the download code is complicated by the fact that the server checks the User-agent header of the request, basically to make sure that the download takes place through a browser. To overcome this, we add a header corresponding to a request coming from a browser (such as Firefox) in our code.\n\n# Set URL+filename\nurl = 'https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_airports.zip'\nfilename = 'output/ne_10m_airports.zip'\n# Download\nopener = urllib.request.build_opener()\nopener.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/116.0')]\nurllib.request.install_opener(opener)\nurllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)\n# Extract\nf = zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r')\nf.extractall('output')\nf.close()\n\nThe ESRI Shapefile that has been created in the output directory can then be imported and plotted (Figure 7.1) as follows using geopandas.\n\nne = gpd.read_file(filename.replace('.zip', '.shp'))\nne.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: World airports layer, downloaded from the Natural Earth Data website using Python",

    "text": "7.3 Geographic data packages\nSeveral Python packages have been developed for accessing geographic data, two of which are demonstrated below. These provide interfaces to one or more spatial libraries or geoportals and aim to make data access even quicker from the command line.\nAdministrative borders are often useful in spatial analysis. These can be accessed with the cartopy.io.shapereader.natural_earth function from the cartopy package (Met Office 2010 - 2015). For example, the following code loads the 'admin_2_counties' dataset of US counties into a GeoDataFrame.\n\nfilename = cartopy.io.shapereader.natural_earth(\n    resolution='10m',\n    category='cultural',\n    name='admin_2_counties'\n)\ncounties = gpd.read_file(filename)\ncounties\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cartopy/io/__init__.py:241: DownloadWarning: Downloading: https://naturalearth.s3.amazonaws.com/10m_cultural/ne_10m_admin_2_counties.zip\n  warnings.warn(f'Downloading: {url}', DownloadWarning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEATURECLA\nSCALERANK\n...\nNAME_ZHT\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n霍特科姆縣\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-122.75302 48.9...\n\n\n1\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n奧卡諾根縣\nPOLYGON ((-120.85196 48.99251, ...\n\n\n2\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n費里縣\nPOLYGON ((-118.83688 48.99251, ...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n3221\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n維拉爾巴\nPOLYGON ((-66.44407 18.17665, -...\n\n\n3222\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n大薩瓦納\nPOLYGON ((-66.88464 18.02481, -...\n\n\n3223\nAdmin-2 scale rank\n0\n...\n馬里考\nPOLYGON ((-66.89856 18.1879, -6...\n\n\n\n\n3224 rows × 62 columns\n\n\n\nThe resulting layer counties is shown in Figure 7.2.\n\ncounties.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: US counties, downloaded from the Natural Earth Data website using package cartopy\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Figure 7.2 x-axis spans the entire range of longitues, between -180 and 180, since the Aleutian Islands county (which is small and difficult to see on the map) crosses the International Date Line.\nOther layers can be accessed the same way. You need to specify the resolution, category, and name of the requested dataset in Natural Earth Data, then run the cartopy.io.shapereader.natural_earth, which downloads the file(s) and returns the path, and read the file into the Python environment, e.g., using gpd.read_file. This is an alternative approach to “directly” downloading files as shown earlier (Section 7.2).\nThe second example uses the osmnx package (Boeing 2017) to find parks from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. As illustrated in the code-chunk below, OpenStreetMap data can be obtained using the ox.features.features_from_place function. The first argument is a string which is geocoded to a polygon (the ox.features.features_from_bbox and ox.features.features_from_polygon can also be used to query a custom area of interest). The second argument specifies the OSM tag(s), selecting which OSM elements we’re interested in (parks, in this case), represented by key-value pairs.\n\nparks = ox.features.features_from_place(\n    query='leeds uk', \n    tags={'leisure': 'park'}\n)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/osmnx/features.py:279: FutureWarning: The 'unary_union' attribute is deprecated, use the 'union_all()' method instead.\n  polygon = gdf_place[\"geometry\"].unary_union\n\n\nThe result is a GeoDataFrame with the parks in Leeds. Now, we can plots the geometries with the name property in the tooltips using explore (Figure 7.3).\n\nparks[['name', 'geometry']].explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Parks in Leeds, based on OpenStreetMap data, downloaded using package osmnx\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the osmnx package downloads OSM data from the Overpass API, which is rate limited and therefore unsuitable for queries covering very large areas. To overcome this limitation, you can download OSM data extracts, such as in Shapefile format from Geofabrik, and then load them from the file into the Python environment.\nOpenStreetMap is a vast global database of crowd-sourced data, is growing daily, and has a wider ecosystem of tools enabling easy access to the data, from the Overpass turbo web service for rapid development and testing of OSM queries to osm2pgsql for importing the data into a PostGIS database. Although the quality of datasets derived from OSM varies, the data source and wider OSM ecosystems have many advantages: they provide datasets that are available globally, free of charge, and constantly improving thanks to an army of volunteers. Using OSM encourages ‘citizen science’ and contributions back to the digital commons (you can start editing data representing a part of the world you know well at www.openstreetmap.org).\nOne way to obtain spatial information is to perform geocoding—transform a description of a location, usually an address, into a set of coordinates. This is typically done by sending a query to an online service and getting the location as a result. Many such services exist that differ in the used method of geocoding, usage limitations, costs, or API key requirements. Nominatim is a well-known free service, based on OpenStreetMap data, and there are many other free and commercial geocoding services.\ngeopandas provides the gpd.tools.geocode, which can geocode addresses to a GeoDataFrame. Internally it uses the geopy package, supporting several providers through the provider parameter (use geopy.geocoders.SERVICE_TO_GEOCODER to see possible options). The example below searches for John Snow blue plaque coordinates located on a building in the Soho district of London. The result is a GeoDataFrame with the address we passed to gpd.tools.geocode, and the detected point location.\n\nresult = gpd.tools.geocode('54 Frith St, London W1D 4SJ, UK')\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\naddress\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-0.13178 51.51377)\n54, Frith Street, W1D 5LD, Frit...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, (1) we can pass a list of multiple addresses instead of just one, resulting in a GeoDataFrame with corresponding multiple rows, and (2) “No Results” responses are represented by POINT EMPTY geometries, as shown in the following example.\n\nresult = gpd.tools.geocode([\n    '54 Frith St, London W1D 4SJ, UK', \n    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n])\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\naddress\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (-0.13178 51.51377)\n54, Frith Street, W1D 5LD, Frit...\n\n\n1\nPOINT EMPTY\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is visualized in Figure 7.4 using the .explore function. We are using the marker_kwds parameter of .explore to make the marker larger (see Section 8.3.2).\n\nresult.iloc[[0]].explore(color='red', marker_kwds={'radius':20})\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Specific address in London, geocoded into a GeoDataFrame",

    "text": "7.4 File formats\nGeographic datasets are usually stored as files or in spatial databases. File formats usually can either store vector or raster data, while spatial databases such as PostGIS can store both. The large variety of file formats may seem bewildering, but there has been much consolidation and standardization since the beginnings of GIS software in the 1960s when the first widely distributed program (SYMAP) for spatial analysis was created at Harvard University (Coppock and Rhind 1991).\nGDAL (which originally was pronounced as “goo-dal”, with the double “o” making a reference to object-orientation), the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, has resolved many issues associated with incompatibility between geographic file formats since its release in 2000. GDAL provides a unified and high-performance interface for reading and writing of many raster and vector data formats. Many open and proprietary GIS programs, including GRASS, ArcGIS and QGIS, use GDAL behind their GUIs for doing the legwork of ingesting and spitting out geographic data in appropriate formats. Most Python packages for working with spatial data, including geopandas and rasterio used in this book, also rely on GDAL for importing and exporting spatial data files.\nGDAL provides access to more than 200 vector and raster data formats. Table 7.1 presents some basic information about selected and often used spatial file formats.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Commonly used spatial data file formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nExtension\nInfo\nType\nModel\n\n\n\n\nESRI Shapefile\n.shp (the main file)\nPopular format consisting of at least three files.

Beyond defining the Simple Features data model (see Section 1.2.4), the OGC also coordinates the development of open standards, for example as used in file formats such as KML and GeoPackage. Open file formats of the kind endorsed by the OGC have several advantages over proprietary formats: the standards are published, ensure transparency and open up the possibility for users to further develop and adjust the file formats to their specific needs.\nESRI Shapefile is the most popular vector data exchange format; however, it is not an fully open format (though its specification is open). It was developed in the early 1990s and, from a modern standpoint, has a number of limitations. First of all, it is a multi-file format, which consists of at least three files. It also only supports 255 columns, its column names are restricted to ten characters and the file size limit is 2 GB. Furthermore, ESRI Shapefile does not support all possible geometry types, for example, it is unable to distinguish between a polygon and a multipolygon. Despite these limitations, a viable alternative had been missing for a long time. In 2014, GeoPackage emerged, and seems to be a more than suitable replacement candidate for ESRI Shapefile. GeoPackage is a format for exchanging geospatial information and an OGC standard. This standard describes the rules on how to store geospatial information in a tiny SQLite container. Hence, GeoPackage is a lightweight spatial database container, which allows the storage of vector and raster data but also of non-spatial data and extensions. Aside from GeoPackage, there are other geospatial data exchange formats worth checking out (Table 7.1).\nThe GeoTIFF format seems to be the most prominent raster data format. It allows spatial information, such as the CRS definition and the transformation matrix (see Section 1.3.1), to be embedded within a TIFF file. Similar to ESRI Shapefile, this format was firstly developed in the 1990s, but as an open format. Additionally, GeoTIFF is still being expanded and improved. One of the most significant recent addition to the GeoTIFF format is its variant called COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF). Raster objects saved as COGs can be hosted on HTTP servers, so other people can read only parts of the file without downloading the whole file (Section 7.5.2).\nThere is also a plethora of other spatial data formats that we do not explain in detail or mention in Table 7.1 due to the book limits. If you need to use other formats, we encourage you to read the GDAL documentation about vector and raster drivers. Additionally, some spatial data formats can store other data models (types) than vector or raster. It includes LAS and LAZ formats for storing lidar point clouds, and NetCDF and HDF for storing multidimensional arrays.\nFinally, spatial data is also often stored using tabular (non-spatial) text formats, including CSV files or Excel spreadsheets. This can be convenient to share spatial (point) datasets with people who, or software that, struggle with spatial data formats. If necessary, the table can be converted to a point layer (see examples in Section 1.2.6 and Section 3.2.3).",

    "text": "7.5 Data input (I)\nExecuting commands such as gpd.read_file (the main function we use for loading vector data) or rasterio.open+.read (the main group of functions used for loading raster data) silently sets off a chain of events that reads data from files. Moreover, there are many Python packages containing a wide range of geographic data or providing simple access to different data sources. All of them load the data into the Python environment or, more precisely, assign objects to your workspace, stored in RAM and accessible within the Python session. The latter is the most straightforward approach, suitable when RAM is not a limiting factor. For large vector layers and rasters, partial reading may be required. For vector layers, we will demonstrate how to read subsets of vector layers, filtered by attributes or by location (Section 7.5.1). For rasters, we already showed earlier in the book how the user can choose which specific bands to read (Section 1.3.1), or read resampled data to a lower resolution (Section 4.3.2). In this section, we also show how to read specific rectangular extents (“windows”) from a raster file (Section 7.5.2).\n\n7.5.1 Vector data\nSpatial vector data comes in a wide variety of file formats. Most popular representations such as .shp, .geojson, and .gpkg files can be imported and exported with geopandas functions read_file and to_file (covered in Section 7.6), respectively.\ngeopandas uses GDAL to read and write data, via pyogrio since geopandas version 1.0.0 (previously via fiona). After pyogrio is imported, pyogrio.list_drivers can be used to list drivers available to GDAL, including whether they can ('r'), append ('a'), or write ('w') data, or all three.\n\npyogrio.list_drivers()\n\n{'PCIDSK': 'rw',\n 'PDS4': 'rw',\n ...\n 'AVCE00': 'r',\n 'HTTP': 'r'}\nThe first argument of the geopandas versatile data import function gpd.read_file is filename, which is typically a string, but can also be a file connection. The content of a string could vary between different drivers. In most cases, as with the ESRI Shapefile (.shp) or the GeoPackage format (.gpkg), the filename argument would be a path or a URL to an actual file, such as geodata.gpkg. The driver is automatically selected based on the file extension, as demonstrated for a .gpkg file below.\n\nworld = gpd.read_file('data/world.gpkg')\n\nFor some drivers, such as a File Geodatabase (OpenFileGDB), filename could be provided as a folder name. GeoJSON, a plain text format, on the other hand, can be read from a .geojson file, but also from a string.\n\ngpd.read_file('{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[34.838848,31.296301]}')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOINT (34.83885 31.2963)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome vector formats, such as GeoPackage, can store multiple data layers. By default, gpd.read_file reads the first layer of the file specified in filename. However, using the layer argument you can specify any other layer. To list the available layers, we can use function gpd.list_layers (or pyogrio.list_layers).\nThe gpd.read_file function also allows for reading just parts of the file into RAM with two possible mechanisms. The first one is related to the where argument, which allows specifying what part of the data to read using an SQL WHERE expression. An example below extracts data for Tanzania only from the world.gpkg file (Figure 7.5 (a)). It is done by specifying that we want to get all rows for which name_long equals to 'Tanzania'.\n\ntanzania = gpd.read_file('data/world.gpkg', where='name_long=\"Tanzania\"')\ntanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso_a2\nname_long\n...\ngdpPercap\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nTZ\nTanzania\n...\n2402.099404\nMULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95,...\n\n\n\n\n1 rows × 11 columns\n\n\n\nIf you do not know the names of the available columns, a good approach is to read the layer metadata using pyogrio.read_info. The resulting object contains, among other properties, the column names (fields) and data types (dtypes):\n\ninfo = pyogrio.read_info('data/world.gpkg')\ninfo['fields']\n\narray(['iso_a2', 'name_long', 'continent', 'region_un', 'subregion',\n       'type', 'area_km2', 'pop', 'lifeExp', 'gdpPercap'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\ninfo['dtypes']\n\narray(['object', 'object', 'object', 'object', 'object', 'object',\n       'float64', 'float64', 'float64', 'float64'], dtype=object)\n\n\nThe second mechanism uses the mask argument to filter data based on intersection with an existing geometry. This argument expects a geometry (GeoDataFrame, GeoSeries, or shapely geometry) representing the area where we want to extract the data. Let’s try it using a small example—we want to read polygons from our file that intersect with the buffer of 50,000 \\(m\\) of Tanzania’s borders. To do it, we need to transform the geometry to a projected CRS (such as EPSG:32736), prepare our “filter” by creating the buffer (Section 4.2.3), and transform back to the original CRS to be used as a mask (Figure 7.5 (a)).\n\ntanzania_buf = tanzania.to_crs(32736).buffer(50000).to_crs(4326)\n\nNow, we can pass the “filter” geometry tanzania_buf to the mask argument of gpd.read_file.\n\ntanzania_neigh = gpd.read_file('data/world.gpkg', mask=tanzania_buf)\n\nOur result, shown in Figure 7.5 (b), contains Tanzania and every country intersecting with its 50,000 \\(m\\) buffer. Note that the last two expressions are used to add text labels with the name_long of each country, placed at the country centroid.\n# Using 'where'\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntanzania.plot(ax=ax, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='grey')\ntanzania.apply(\n    lambda x: ax.annotate(text=x['name_long'], \n    xy=x.geometry.centroid.coords[0], ha='center'), axis=1\n);\n# Using 'mask'\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntanzania_neigh.plot(ax=ax, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='grey')\ntanzania_buf.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='red')\ntanzania_neigh.apply(\n    lambda x: ax.annotate(text=x['name_long'],\n    xy=x.geometry.centroid.coords[0], ha='center'), axis=1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using a where query (matching 'Tanzania')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using a mask (a geometry shown in red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Reading a subset of the vector layer file world.gpkg\n\n\n\nA different, gpd.read_postgis, function can be used to read a vector layer from a PostGIS database.\nOften we need to read CSV files (or other tabular formats) which have x and y coordinate columns, and turn them into a GeoDataFrame with point geometries. To do that, we can import the file using pandas (e.g., using pd.read_csv or pd.read_excel), then go from DataFrame to GeoDataFrame using the gpd.points_from_xy function, as shown earlier in the book (See Section 1.2.6 and Section 3.2.3). For example, the table cycle_hire_xy.csv, where the coordinates are stored in the X and Y columns in EPSG:4326, can be imported, converted to a GeoDataFrame, and plotted, as follows (Figure 7.6).\n\ncycle_hire = pd.read_csv('data/cycle_hire_xy.csv')\ngeom = gpd.points_from_xy(cycle_hire['X'], cycle_hire['Y'], crs=4326)\ngeom = gpd.GeoSeries(geom)\ncycle_hire_xy = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data=cycle_hire, geometry=geom)\ncycle_hire_xy.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: The cycle_hire_xy.csv table transformed to a point layer\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of columns describing ‘XY’ coordinates, a single column can also contain the geometry information, not necessarily points but possible any other geometry type. Well-known text (WKT), well-known binary (WKB), and GeoJSON are examples of formats used to encode geometry in such a column. For instance, the world_wkt.csv file has a column named 'WKT', representing polygons of the world’s countries (in WKT format).

However, GDAL also allows reading data directly from online resources, such as HTTP/HTTPS/FTP web resources. Let’s try it by connecting to the global monthly snow probability at 500 \\(m\\) resolution for the period 2000-2012 (Hengl 2021). Snow probability for December is stored as a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file (see Section 7.4) and can be accessed by its HTTPS URI.\n\nsrc = rasterio.open('https://zenodo.org/record/5774954/files/clm_snow.prob_esacci.dec_p.90_500m_s0..0cm_2000..2012_v2.0.tif')\nsrc\n\n&lt;open DatasetReader name='https://zenodo.org/record/5774954/files/clm_snow.prob_esacci.dec_p.90_500m_s0..0cm_2000..2012_v2.0.tif' mode='r'&gt;\n\n\nIn the example above rasterio.open creates a connection to the file without obtaining any values, as we did for the local srtm.tif file. The values can be read into an ndarray using the .read method of the file connection (Section 1.3.1). Using parameters of .read allows us to just read a small portion of the data, without downloading the entire file. This is very useful when working with large datasets hosted online from resource-constrained computing environments such as laptops.\nFor example, we can read a specified rectangular extent of the raster. With rasterio, this is done using the so-called windowed reading capabilities. Note that, with windowed reading, we import just a subset of the raster extent into an ndarray covering any partial extent. Windowed reading is therefore memory- (and, in this case, bandwidth-) efficient, since it avoids reading the entire raster into memory. It can also be considered an alternative pathway to cropping (Section 5.2).\nTo read a raster window, let’s first define the bounding box coordinates. For example, here we use a \\(10 \\times 10\\) degrees extent coinciding with Reykjavik.\n\nxmin=-30\nxmax=-20\nymin=60\nymax=70\n\nUsing the extent coordinates along with the raster transformation matrix, we create a window object, using the rasterio.windows.from_bounds function. This function basically “translates” the extent from coordinates, to row/column ranges.\n\nw = rasterio.windows.from_bounds(\n    left=xmin, \n    bottom=ymin,\n    right=xmax,\n    top=ymax, \n    transform=src.transform\n)\nw\n\nWindow(col_off=35999.99999999998, row_off=4168.799999999996, width=2399.9999999999927, height=2400.0)\n\n\nNow we can read the partial array, according to the specified window w, by passing it to the .read method.\n\nr = src.read(1, window=w)\nr\n\narray([[100, 100, 100, ..., 255, 255, 255],\n       [100, 100, 100, ..., 255, 255, 255],\n       [100, 100, 100, ..., 255, 255, 255],\n       ...,\n       [255, 255, 255, ..., 255, 255, 255],\n       [255, 255, 255, ..., 255, 255, 255],\n       [255, 255, 255, ..., 255, 255, 255]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\nNote that the transformation matrix of the window is not the same as that of the original raster (unless it incidentally starts from the top-left corner)! Therefore, we must re-create the transformation matrix, with the modified origin (xmin,ymax), yet the same resolution, as follows.\n\nw_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=xmin, \n    north=ymax, \n    xsize=src.transform[0],\n    ysize=abs(src.transform[4])\n)\nw_transform\n\nAffine(0.00416666666666667, 0.0, -30.0,\n       0.0, -0.00416666666666667, 70.0)\n\n\nThe array r along with the updated transformation matrix w_transform comprise the partial window, which we can keep working with just like with any other raster, as shown in previous chapters. Figure 7.8 shows the result, along with the location of Reykjavik.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrasterio.plot.show(r, transform=w_transform, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(shapely.Point(-21.94, 64.15)).plot(ax=ax, color='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: Raster window read from a remote Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file source\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is to extract raster values at particular points, directly from the file connection, using the .sample method (see Section 3.3.1). For example, we can get the snow probability for December in Reykjavik (70%) by specifying its coordinates and applying .sample.\n\ncoords = (-21.94, 64.15)\nvalues = src.sample([coords])\nlist(values)\n\n[array([70], dtype=uint8)]\n\n\nThe example above efficiently extracts and downloads a single value instead of the entire GeoTIFF file, saving valuable resources.\nNote that URIs can also identify vector datasets, enabling you to import datasets from online storage with geopandas, including datasets within ZIP archives hosted on the web.\n\ngpd.read_file(\"zip+https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/files/11151652/coutwildrnp.zip\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERIMETER\nFEATURE2\n...\nSTATE\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.221070\nNone\n...\nUT\nPOLYGON ((-111.73528 41.99509, ...\n\n\n1\n0.755827\nNone\n...\nUT\nPOLYGON ((-112.00385 41.5527, -...\n\n\n2\n1.708510\nNone\n...\nCO\nPOLYGON ((-106.79289 40.98353, ...\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n64\n0.263251\nNone\n...\nCO\nPOLYGON ((-108.35329 37.26869, ...\n\n\n65\n0.119581\nNone\n...\nCO\nPOLYGON ((-108.44212 37.29754, ...\n\n\n66\n0.120627\nNone\n...\nCO\nPOLYGON ((-108.5527 37.28285, -...\n\n\n\n\n67 rows × 11 columns",

    "text": "7.6 Data output (O)\nWriting geographic data allows you to convert from one format to another and to save newly created objects for permanent storage. Depending on the data type (vector or raster), object class (e.g., GeoDataFrame), and type and amount of stored information (e.g., object size, range of values), it is important to know how to store spatial files in the most efficient way. The next two subsections will demonstrate how to do this.\n\n7.6.1 Vector data\nThe counterpart of gpd.read_file is the .to_file method that a GeoDataFrame has. It allows you to write GeoDataFrame objects to a wide range of geographic vector file formats, including the most common ones, such as .geojson, .shp and .gpkg. Based on the file name, .to_file decides automatically which driver to use. The speed of the writing process depends also on the driver.\nFor example, to export the world layer to a GeoPackage file, we can use .to_file and specify the output file name.\n\nworld.to_file('output/world.gpkg')\n\nNote, that if you try to write to the same data source again, the function will overwrite the file.\n\nworld.to_file('output/world.gpkg')\n\nInstead of overwriting the file, we could add new rows to the file with mode='a' (“append” mode, as opposed to the default mode='w' for the “write” mode). Appending is supported by several spatial formats, including GeoPackage.\n\nworld.to_file('output/w_many_features.gpkg')\nworld.to_file('output/w_many_features.gpkg', mode='a')\n\nNow, w_many_features.gpkg contains a polygonal layer named world with two “copies” of each country (that is 177×2=354 features, whereas the world layer has 177 features).\n\ngpd.read_file('output/w_many_features.gpkg').shape\n\n(354, 11)\n\n\nAlternatively, you can create another, separate, layer, within the same file, which is supported by some formats, including GeoPackage.\n\nworld.to_file('output/w_many_layers.gpkg')\nworld.to_file('output/w_many_layers.gpkg', layer='world2')\n\nIn this case, w_many_layers.gpkg has two “layers”: w_many_layers (same as the file name, when layer is unspecified) and world2. Incidentally, the contents of the two layers is identical, but this does not have to be. Each layer from such a file can be imported separately using the layer argument of gpd.read_file.\n\nlayer1 = gpd.read_file('output/w_many_layers.gpkg', layer='w_many_layers')\nlayer2 = gpd.read_file('output/w_many_layers.gpkg', layer='world2')\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Raster data\nTo write a raster file using rasterio, we need to pass a raster file path to rasterio.open in writing ('w') mode. This implies creating a new empty file (or overwriting an existing one). Next, we need to write the raster values to the file using the .write method of the file connection. Finally, we should close the file connection using the .close method.\nAs opposed to reading mode ('r', the default) mode, the rasterio.open function in writing mode needs quite a lot of information, in addition to the file path and mode:\n\ndriver—The file format. The general recommendation is 'GTiff' for GeoTIFF, but other formats are also supported (see Table 7.1)\nheight—Number of rows\nwidth—Number of columns\ncount—Number of bands\nnodata—The value which represents “No Data”, if any\ndtype—The raster data type, one of numpy types supported by the driver (e.g., np.int64) (see Table 7.2)\ncrs—The CRS, e.g., using an EPSG code (such as 4326)\ntransform—The transform matrix\ncompress—A compression method to apply, such as 'lzw'. This is optional and most useful for large rasters. Note that, at the time of writing, this does not work well for writing multiband rasters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that 'GTiff (GeoTIFF, .tif), which is the recommended driver, supports just some of the possible numpy data types (see Table 7.2). Importantly, it does not support np.int64, the default int type. The recommendation in such case it to use np.int32 (if the range is sufficient), or np.float64.\n\n\nOnce the file connection with the right metadata is ready, we do the actual writing using the .write method of the file connection. If there are several bands we may execute the .write method several times, as in .write(a,n), where a is a two-dimensional array representing a single band, and n is the band index (starting from 1, see below). Alternatively, we can write all bands at once, as in .write(a), where a is a three-dimensional array. When done, we close the file connection using the .close method. Some functions, such as rasterio.warp.reproject used for resampling and reprojecting (Section 4.3.3 and Section 6.8) directly accept a file connection in 'w' mode, thus handling the writing (of a resampled or reprojected raster) for us.\nMost of the properties are either straightforward to choose, based on our aims, (e.g., driver, crs, compress, nodata), or directly derived from the array with the raster values itself (e.g., height, width, count, dtype). The most complicated property is the transform, which specifies the raster origin and resolution. The transform is typically either obtained from an existing raster (serving as a “template”), created from scratch based on manually specified origin and resolution values (e.g., using rasterio.transform.from_origin), or calculated automatically (e.g., using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform), as shown in previous chapters.\nEarlier in the book, we have already demonstrated five common scenarios of writing rasters, covering the above-mentioned considerations:\n\nCreating from scratch (Section 1.3.2)—we created and wrote two rasters from scratch by associating the elev and grain arrays with an arbitrary spatial extent. The custom arbitrary transformation matrix was created using rasterio.transform.from_origin\nAggregating (Section 4.3.2)—we wrote an aggregated a raster, by resampling from an exising raster file, then updating the transformation matrix using .transform.scale\nResampling (Section 4.3.3)—we resampled a raster into a custom grid, manually creating the transformation matrix using rasterio.transform.from_origin, then resampling and writing the output using rasterio.warp.reproject\nMasking and cropping (Section 5.2)—we wrote masked and/or cropped arrays from a raster, possibly updating the transformation matrix and dimensions (when cropping)\nReprojecting (Section 6.8)—we reprojected a raster into another CRS, by automatically calculating an optimal transform using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform, then resampling and writing the output using rasterio.warp.reproject\n\nTo summarize, the raster-writing scenarios differ in two aspects:\n\nThe way that the transformation matrix for the output raster is obtained:\n\nImported from an existing raster (see below)\nCreated from scratch, using rasterio.transform.from_origin (Section 1.3.2)\nCalculate automatically, using rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform (Section 6.8)\n\nThe way that the raster is written:\n\nUsing the .write method, given an existing array (Section 1.3.2, Section 4.3.2)\nUsing rasterio.warp.reproject to calculate and write a resampled or reprojected array (Section 4.3.3, Section 6.8)\n\n\nA miminal example of writing a raster file named r.tif from scratch, to remind the main concepts, is given below. First, we create a small \\(2 \\times 2\\) array.\n\nr = np.array([1,2,3,4]).reshape(2,2).astype(np.int8)\nr\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]], dtype=int8)\n\n\nNext, we define a transformation matrix, specifying the origin and resolution.\n\nnew_transform = rasterio.transform.from_origin(\n    west=-0.5, \n    north=51.5, \n    xsize=2, \n    ysize=2\n)\nnew_transform\n\nAffine(2.0, 0.0, -0.5,\n       0.0, -2.0, 51.5)\n\n\nThen, we establish the writing-mode file connection to r.tif, which will be eithe created or overwritten.\n\ndst = rasterio.open(\n    'output/r.tif', 'w', \n    driver = 'GTiff',\n    height = r.shape[0],\n    width = r.shape[1],\n    count = 1,\n    dtype = r.dtype,\n    crs = 4326,\n    transform = new_transform\n)\ndst\n\n&lt;open DatasetWriter name='output/r.tif' mode='w'&gt;\n\n\nNext, we write the array of values into the file connection with the .write method. Keep in mind that r here is a two-dimensional array representing one band, and 1 is the band index where the array is written into the file.\n\ndst.write(r, 1)\n\nFinally, we close the connection.\n\ndst.close()\n\nThese expressions, taken together, create a new file output/r.tif, which is a \\(2 \\times 2\\) raster, having a 2 decimal degree resolution, with the top-left corner placed over London.\nTo make the picture of raster export complete, there are three important concepts we have not covered yet: array and raster data types, writing multiband rasters, and handling “No Data” values.\nArrays (i.e., ndarray objects defined in package numpy) are used to store raster values when reading them from file, using .read (Section 1.3.1). All values in an array are of the same type, whereas the numpy package supports numerous numeric data types of various precision (and, accordingly, memory footprint). Raster formats, such as GeoTIFF, support (a subset of) exactly the same data types as numpy, which means that reading a raster file uses as little RAM as possible. The most useful types for raster data, and thir support in GeoTIFF are summarized in Table 7.2.\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Commonly used numpy data types for rasters, and whether they are supported by the GeoTIFF ('GTiff') file format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData type\nDescription\nGeoTIFF\n\n\n\n\nint8\nInteger in a single byte (-128 to 127)\n+\n\n\nint16\nInteger in 16 bits (-32768 to 32767)\n+\n\n\nint32\nInteger in 32 bits (-2147483648 to 2147483647)\n\n\n\nint64\nInteger in 64 bits (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)\n\n\n\nuint8\nUnsigned integer in 8 bits (0 to 255)\n+\n\n\nuint16\nUnsigned integer in 16 bits (0 to 65535)\n+\n\n\nuint32\nUnsigned integer in 32 bits (0 to 4294967295)\n+\n\n\nuint64\nUnsigned integer in 64 bits (0 to 18446744073709551615)\n\n\n\nfloat16\nHalf-precision (16 bit) float (-65504 to 65504)\n\n\n\nfloat32\nSingle-precision (32 bit) float (1e-38 to 1e38)\n+\n\n\nfloat64\nDouble-precision (64 bit) float (1e-308 to 1e308)\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raster data type needs to be specified when writing a raster, typically using the same type as that of the array to be written (e.g., see the dtype=r.dtype part in the last example). For an existing raster file, the data type can be queried through the .dtype property of the metadata (.meta['dtype']).\n\nrasterio.open('output/r.tif').meta['dtype']\n\n'int8'\n\n\nThe above expression shows that the GeoTIFF file r.tif has the data type np.int8, as specified when creating the file with rasterio.open, according to the data type of the array we wrote into the file (dtype=r.dtype).\n\nr.dtype\n\ndtype('int8')\n\n\nWhen reading the raster file back into the Python session, the exact same array is recreated.\n\nrasterio.open('output/r.tif').read().dtype\n\ndtype('int8')\n\n\nThese code sections demonstrate the agreement between GeoTIFF (and other file formats) data types, which are universal and understood by many programs and programming languages, and the corresponding ndarray data types which are defined by numpy (Table 7.2).\nWriting multiband rasters is similar to writing single-band rasters, only that we need to:\n\nDefine a number of bands other than count=1, according to the number of bands we are going to write\nExecute the .write method multiple times, once for each layer\n\nFor completeness, let’s demonstrate writing a multi-band raster named r3.tif, which is similar to r.tif, but having three bands with values r*1, r*2, and r*3 (i.e., the array r multiplied by 1, 2, or 3). Since most of the metadata is going to be the same, this is also a good opportunity to (re-)demonstrate updating an existing metadata object rather than creating one from scratch. First, let’s make a copy of the metadata we already have in r.tif.\n\ndst_kwds = rasterio.open('output/r.tif').meta\ndst_kwds\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'int8',\n 'nodata': None,\n 'width': 2,\n 'height': 2,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(2.0, 0.0, -0.5,\n        0.0, -2.0, 51.5)}\n\n\nSecond, we update the count entry, replacing 1 (single-band) with 3 (three-band) using the .update method.\n\ndst_kwds.update(count=3)\ndst_kwds\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'int8',\n 'nodata': None,\n 'width': 2,\n 'height': 2,\n 'count': 3,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(2.0, 0.0, -0.5,\n        0.0, -2.0, 51.5)}\n\n\nFinally, we can create a file connection using the updated metadata, write the values of the three bands, and close the connection (note that we are switching to the “keyword argument” syntax of Python function calls here; see note in Section 4.3.2).\n\ndst = rasterio.open('output/r3.tif', 'w', **dst_kwds)\ndst.write(r*1, 1)\ndst.write(r*2, 2)\ndst.write(r*3, 3)\ndst.close()\n\nAs a result, a three-band raster named r3.tif is created.\nRasters often contain “No Data” values, representing missing data, for example, unreliable measurements due to clouds or pixels outside of the photographed extent. In a numpy ndarray object, “No Data” values may be represented by the special np.nan value. However, due to computer memory limitations, only arrays of type float can contain np.nan, while arrays of type int cannot. For int rasters containing “No Data”, we typically mark missing data with a specific value beyond the valid range (e.g., -9999). The missing data “flag” definition is stored in the file (set through the nodata property of the file connection, see above). When reading an int raster with “No Data” back into Python, we need to be aware of the flag, if any. Let’s demonstrate it through examples.\nWe will start with the simpler case, rasters of type float. Since float arrays may contain the “native” value np.nan, representing “No Data” is straightforward. For example, suppose that we have a float array of size \\(2 \\times 2\\) containing one np.nan value.\n\nr = np.array([1.1,2.1,np.nan,4.1]).reshape(2,2)\nr\n\narray([[1.1, 2.1],\n       [nan, 4.1]])\n\n\n\nr.dtype\n\ndtype('float64')\n\n\nWhen writing this type of array to a raster file, we do not need to specify any particular nodata “flag” value.\n\ndst = rasterio.open(\n    'output/r_nodata_float.tif', 'w', \n    driver = 'GTiff',\n    height = r.shape[0],\n    width = r.shape[1],\n    count = 1,\n    dtype = r.dtype,\n    crs = 4326,\n    transform = new_transform\n)\ndst.write(r, 1)\ndst.close()\n\nThis is equivalent to nodata=None.\n\nrasterio.open('output/r_nodata_float.tif').meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'float64',\n 'nodata': None,\n 'width': 2,\n 'height': 2,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(2.0, 0.0, -0.5,\n        0.0, -2.0, 51.5)}\n\n\nReading from the raster back into the Python session reproduces the same exact array, including np.nan.\n\nrasterio.open('output/r_nodata_float.tif').read()\n\narray([[[1.1, 2.1],\n        [nan, 4.1]]])\n\n\nNow, conversely, suppose that we have an int array with missing data, where the “missing” value must inevitably be marked using a specific int “flag” value, such as -9999 (remember that we can’t store np.nan in an int array!).\n\nr = np.array([1,2,-9999,4]).reshape(2,2).astype(np.int32)\nr\n\narray([[    1,     2],\n       [-9999,     4]], dtype=int32)\n\n\n\nr.dtype\n\ndtype('int32')\n\n\nWhen writing the array to file, we must specify nodata=-9999 to keep track of our “No Data” flag.\n\ndst = rasterio.open(\n    'output/r_nodata_int.tif', 'w', \n    driver = 'GTiff',\n    height = r.shape[0],\n    width = r.shape[1],\n    count = 1,\n    dtype = r.dtype,\n    nodata = -9999,\n    crs = 4326,\n    transform = new_transform\n)\ndst.write(r, 1)\ndst.close()\n\nExamining the metadata of the file we’ve just created confirms that the nodata=-9999 setting was stored in the file r_nodata_int.tif.\n\nrasterio.open('output/r_nodata_int.tif').meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'int32',\n 'nodata': -9999.0,\n 'width': 2,\n 'height': 2,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(2.0, 0.0, -0.5,\n        0.0, -2.0, 51.5)}\n\n\nIf you try to open the file in GIS software, such as QGIS, you will see the missing data interpreted (e.g., the pixel shown as blank), meaning that the software is aware of the flag. However, reading the data back into Python reproduces an int array with -9999, due to the limitation of int arrays stated before/\n\nsrc = rasterio.open('output/r_nodata_int.tif')\nr = src.read()\nr\n\narray([[[    1,     2],\n        [-9999,     4]]], dtype=int32)\n\n\nThe Python user must therefore be mindful of “No Data” int rasters, for example to avoid interpreting the value -9999 literally. For instance, if we “forget” about the nodata flag, the literal calculation of the .mean would incorrectly include the value -9999.\n\nr.mean()\n\n-2498.0\n\n\nThere are two basic ways to deal with the situation: either converting the raster to float, or using a “No Data” mask. The first approach, simple and particularly relevant for small rasters where memory constraints are irrelevant, is to go from int to float, to gain the ability of the natural np.nan representation. Here is how we can do this with r_nodata_int.tif. We detect the missing data flag, convert the raster to float, then assign np.nan into the cells that are supposed to be missing.\n\nmask = r == src.nodata\nr = r.astype(np.float64)\nr[mask] = np.nan\nr\n\narray([[[ 1.,  2.],\n        [nan,  4.]]])\n\n\nFrom there on, we deal with np.nan the usual way, such as using np.nanmean to calculate the mean excluding “No Data”.\n\nnp.nanmean(r)\n\n2.3333333333333335\n\n\nThe second approach is to read the values into a so-called “masked” array, using the argument masked=True of the .read method. A masked array can be thought of as an extended ndarray, with two components: .data (the values) and .mask (a corresponding boolean array marking “No Data” values).\n\nr = src.read(masked=True)\nr\n\nmasked_array(\n  data=[[[1, 2],\n         [--, 4]]],\n  mask=[[[False, False],\n         [ True, False]]],\n  fill_value=-9999,\n  dtype=int32)\n\n\nComplete treatment of masked arrays is beyond the scope of this book. However, the basic idea is that many numpy operations “honor” the mask, so that the user does not have to keep track of the way that “No Data” values are marked, similarly to the natural np.nan representation and regardless of the data type. For example, the .mean of a masked array ignores the value -9999, because it is masked, taking into account just the valid values 1, 2, and 4.\n\nr.mean()\n\n2.3333333333333335\n\n\nSwitching to float and assigning np.nan is the simpler approach, since that way we can keep working with the familiar ndarray data structure for all raster types, whether int or float. Nevertheless, learning how to work with masked arrays can be beneficial when we have good reasons to keep our raster data in int arrays (for example, due to RAM limits) and still perform operations that take missing values into account.\nFinally, keep in mind that, confusingly, float rasters may represent “No Data” using a specific “flag” (such as -9999.0), instead, or in addition to (!), the native np.nan representation. In such cases, the same considerations shown for int apply to float rasters as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoeing, Geoff. 2017. “OSMnx: New Methods for Acquiring, Constructing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Complex Street Networks.” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 65: 126–39. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.05.004.\n\n\nCoppock, J Terry, and David W Rhind. 1991. “The History of GIS.” Geographical Information Systems: Principles and Applications, Vol. 1. 1 (1): 21–43. https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~gisteac/ilw/generic_resources/books_and_papers/Thx1ARTICLE.pdf.\n\n\nHengl, T. 2021. “Global MODIS-based Snow Cover Monthly Long-Term (2000-2012) at 500 m, and Aggregated Monthly Values (2000-2020) at 1 Km.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5774954.\n\n\nMet Office. 2010 - 2015.

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\n\n\n\nA satisfying and important aspect of geographic research is communicating the results. Map making—the art of cartography—is an ancient skill that involves communication, intuition, and an element of creativity. In addition to being fun and creative, cartography also has important practical applications. A carefully crafted map can be the best way of communicating the results of your work, but poorly designed maps can leave a bad impression. Common design issues include poor placement, size and readability of text and careless selection of colors, as outlined in the style guide of the Journal of Maps. Furthermore, poor map making can hinder the communication of results (Brewer 2015):\n\nAmateur-looking maps can undermine your audience’s ability to understand important information and weaken the presentation of a professional data investigation.\n\nMaps have been used for several thousand years for a wide variety of purposes. Historic examples include maps of buildings and land ownership in the Old Babylonian dynasty more than 3000 years ago and Ptolemy’s world map in his masterpiece Geography nearly 2000 years ago (Talbert 2014).\nMap making has historically been an activity undertaken only by, or on behalf of, the elite. This has changed with the emergence of open source mapping software such as mapping packages in Python, R, and other languages, and the “print composer” in QGIS, which enable anyone to make high-quality maps, enabling “citizen science”. Maps are also often the best way to present the findings of geocomputational research in a way that is accessible. Map making is therefore a critical part of geocomputation and its emphasis not only on describing, but also changing the world.\nBasic static display of vector layers in Python is done with the .plot method or the rasterio.plot.show function, for vector layers and rasters, as we saw in Sections Section 1.2.2 and Section 1.3.1, respectively. Other, more advanced uses of these methods, were also encountered in subsequent chapters, when demonstrating the various outputs we got. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive summary of the most useful workflows of these two methods for creating static maps (Section 8.2). Static maps can be easily shared and viewed (whether digitally or in print), however they can only convey as much information as a static image can. Interactive maps provide much more flexibilty in terms of user experience and amount of information, however they often require more work to design and effectively share. Thus, in Section 8.3, we move on to elaborate on the .explore method for creating interactive maps, which was also briefly introduced earlier in Section 1.2.2.",

    "text": "8.2 Static maps\nStatic maps are the most common type of visual output from geocomputation. For example, we have been using .plot and rasterio.plot.show throughout the book, to display geopandas and rasterio geocomputation results, respectively. In this section we systematically review and elaborate on the various properties that can be customized when using those functions.\nA static map is basically a digital image. When stored in a file, standard formats include .png and .pdf for graphical raster and vector outputs, respectively. Thanks to their simplicity, static maps can be shared in a wide variety of ways: in print, through files sent by e-mail, embedded in documents and web pages, etc.\nNevertheless, there are many aesthetic considerations when making a static map, and there is also a wide variety of ways to create static maps using novel presentation methods. This is the focus of the field of cartography, and beyond the scope of this book.\n\n\nLet’s move on to the basics of static mapping with Python.\n\n8.2.1 Minimal examples\nA vector layer (GeoDataFrame) or a geometry column (GeoSeries) can be displayed using their .plot method (Section 1.2.2). A minimal example of a vector layer map is obtained using .plot with nothing but the defaults (Figure 8.1).\n\nnz.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Minimal example of a static vector layer plot with .plot\n\n\n\n\n\nA rasterio raster file connection, or a numpy ndarray, can be displayed using rasterio.plot.show (Section 1.3.1). Figure 8.2 shows a minimal example of a static raster map.\n\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Minimal example of a static raster plot with rasterio.plot.show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Styling\nThe most useful visual properties of the geometries, that can be specified in .plot, include color, edgecolor, and markersize (for points) (Figure 8.3).\nnz.plot(color='lightgrey');\nnz.plot(color='none', edgecolor='blue');\nnz.plot(color='lightgrey', edgecolor='blue');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Light grey fill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) No fill, blue edge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Light grey fill, blue edge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Setting color and edgecolor in static maps of a vector layer\n\n\n\nThe next example uses markersize to get larger points (Figure 8.4). It also demonstrates how to control the overall figure size, such as \\(4 \\times 4\\) \\(in\\) in this case, using plt.subplots to initialize the plot and its figsize parameter to specify dimensions.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))\nnz_height.plot(markersize=100, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Setting markersize in a static map of a vector layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you have probably noticed throughout the book, the plt.subplots function is used to initialize a maptplotlib plot layout, possibly also specifying image size (e.g., Figure 8.4) and multi-panel layout (e.g., Figure 8.17). The returned value is a tuple of Figure and Axes objects, which we conventionally unpack to variables named fig and ax. These two variables represent the entire figure, and the elements of individual sub-figures, respectively.\nFor our purposes in this book, we have been using just the ax object, passing it to the ax parameter in further function calls, in order to add subsequent layers (e.g., Figure 8.15) or other elements (e.g., Figure 8.10) into the same panel. In a single-panel figure, we pass ax itself, whereas in a multi-panel figure we pass individual elements representing a specific panel (such as ax[0] or ax[0][0], depending of the layout; see Section 8.2.7)\nNote that in some of the cases we have used an alternative to plt.subplots—we assigned an initial plot into a variable, conventionally named base, similarly passing it to the ax parameter of further calls, e.g., to add subsequent layers (e.g., Figure 8.14); this (shorter) syntax, though, is less general than plt.subplots and not applicable in some of the cases (such as displaying a raster and a vector layer in the same plot, e.g., Figure 8.15).\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Symbology\nWe can set symbology in a .plot using the following parameters:\n\ncolumn—a column name\nlegend—whether to show a legend\ncmap—color map, a.k.a. color scale, a palette from which the colors are sampled\n\nFor example, Figure 8.5 shows the nz polygons colored according to the 'Median_income' attribute (column), with a legend.\n\nnz.plot(column='Median_income', legend=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Symbology in a static map created with .plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default color scale which you see in Figure 8.5 is cmap='viridis'. The cmap (“color map”) argument can be used to specify one of countless color scales. A first safe choice is often the ColorBrewer collection of color scales, specifically designed for mapping. Any color scale can be reversed, using the _r suffix. Finally, other color scales are available: see the matplotlib colormaps article for details. The following code sections demonstrates three color scale specifications other than the default (Figure 8.6).\nnz.plot(column='Median_income', legend=True, cmap='Reds');\nnz.plot(column='Median_income', legend=True, cmap='Reds_r');\nnz.plot(column='Median_income', legend=True, cmap='plasma');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The 'Reds' color scale from ColorBrewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reversed 'Reds' color scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The 'plasma' color scale from matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Symbology in a static map of a vector layer, created with .plot\n\n\n\nCategorical symbology is also supported, such as when column points to an str attribute. For categorical variables, it makes sense to use a qualitative color scale, such as 'Set1' from ColorBrewer. For example, the following expression sets symbology according to the 'Island' column (Figure 8.7).\n\nnz.plot(column='Island', legend=True, cmap='Set1');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Symbology for a categorical variable\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case the legend interferes with the contents (such as in Figure 8.7), we can modify the legend position using the legend_kwds argument (Figure 8.8).\n\nnz.plot(column='Island', legend=True, cmap='Set1', legend_kwds={'loc': 4});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Setting legend position in .plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rasterio.plot.show function is also based on matplotlib (Hunter 2007), and thus supports the same kinds of cmap arguments (Figure 8.9).\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, cmap='BrBG');\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, cmap='BrBG_r');\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, cmap='gist_earth');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The 'BrBG' color scale from ColorBrewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reversed 'BrBG_r' color scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The 'gist_earth' color scale from matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Symbology in a static map of a raster, with rasterio.plot.show\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no built-in option to display a legend in rasterio.plot.show. The following workaround, reverting to matplotlib methods, can be used to acheive it instead (Figure 8.10). Basically, the code reverts to the matplotlib .colorbar method to add a legend, using the plt.imshow function that draws an image of a numpy array (which rasterio.plot.show is a wrapper of).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ni = plt.imshow(nz_elev.read(1), cmap='BrBG')\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, cmap='BrBG', ax=ax);\nfig.colorbar(i, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: Adding a legend in rasterio.plot.show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Labels\nLabels are often useful to annotate maps and identify the location of specific features. GIS software, as opposed to matplotlib, has specialized algorithms for label placement, e.g., to avoid overlaps between adjacent labels. Furthermore, editing in graphical editing software is sometimes used for fine tuning of label placement. Nevertheless, simple labels added within the Python environment can be a good starting point, both for interactive exploration and sharing analysis results.\nTo demonstrate it, suppose that we have a layer nz1 of regions comprising the New Zealand southern Island.\n\nnz1 = nz[nz['Island'] == 'South']\n\nTo add a label in matplotlib, we use the .annotate method where the important arguments are the label string and the placement (a tuple of the form (x,y)). When labeling vector layers, we typically want to add numerous labels, based on (one or more) attribute of each feature. To do that, we can run a for loop, or use the .apply method, to pass the label text and the coordinates of each feature to .annotate. In the following example, we use the .apply method the pass the region name ('Name' attribute) and the geometry centroid coordinates, for each region, to .annotate. We are also using ha, short for horizontalalignment, with 'center' (other options are 'right' and 'left', see Text properties and layout reference for matplotlib) (Figure 8.11).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nnz1.plot(ax=ax, color='lightgrey', edgecolor='grey')\nnz1.apply(\n    lambda x: ax.annotate(\n        text=x['Name'], \n        xy=x.geometry.centroid.coords[0], \n        ha='center'\n    ), \n    axis=1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: Labels at polygon centroids\n\n\n\n\n\nAs another example, let’s create a map of all regions of New Zealand, with labels for the island names. First, we will calculate the island centroids, which will be the label placement positions.\n\nctr = nz[['Island', 'geometry']].dissolve(by='Island').reset_index()\nctr['geometry'] = ctr.centroid\nctr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nNorth\nPOINT (1834096.904 5732233.908)\n\n\n1\nSouth\nPOINT (1401304.646 5125013.652)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we again use .apply, combined with .annotate, to add the text labels. The main difference compared to the previous example (Figure 8.11) is that we are directly passing the geometry coordinates (.geometry.coords[0]), since the geometries are points rather than polygons. We are also using the weight='bold' argument to use bold font (see Text properties and layout reference for matplotlib for list of other options) (Figure 8.12).  \n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nnz.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nctr.apply(\n    lambda x: ax.annotate(\n        text=x['Island'], \n        xy=x.geometry.coords[0], \n        ha='center',\n        weight='bold'\n    ), \n    axis=1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Labels at points\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that sometimes we wish to add text labels “manually”, one by one, rather than use a loop or .apply. For example, we may want to add labels of specific locations not stored in a layer, or to have control over the specific properties of each label. To add text labels manually, we can run the .annotate expressions one at a time, as shown in the code section below recreating the last result with the “manual” approach (Figure 8.13).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nnz.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='lightgrey')\nax.annotate('This is label 1', (1.8e6, 5.8e6), ha='center', weight='bold')\nax.annotate('This is label 2', (1.4e6, 5.2e6), ha='center', weight='bold');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.13: Labels at points (manual)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.5 Layers\nTo display more than one layer in the same static map, we need to:\n\nStore the first plot in a variable (e.g., base)\nPass it as the ax argument of any subsequent plot(s) (e.g., ax=base)\n\nFor example, here is how we can plot nz and nz_height together (Figure 8.14).\n\nbase = nz.plot(color='none')\nnz_height.plot(ax=base, color='red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.14: Plotting two layers, nz (polygons) and nz_height (points)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine rasters and vector layers in the same plot as well, which we already used earlier in the book, for example when explaining masking and cropping (Figure 5.2). The technique is to initialize a plot with fig,ax=plt.subplots(), then pass ax to any of the separate plots, making them appear together.\nFor example, Figure 8.15 demonstrated plotting a raster with increasingly complicated additions:\n\nPanel (a) shows a raster (New Zealand elevation) and a vector layer (New Zealand administrative division)\nPanel (b) shows the raster with a buffer of 22.2 \\(km\\) around the dissolved administrative borders, representing New Zealand’s territorial waters (see Section 3.3.6)\nPanel (c) shows the raster with two vector layers: the territorial waters (in red) and elevation measurement points (in yellow)\n\n# Raster + vector layer\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, ax=ax)\nnz.to_crs(nz_elev.crs).plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='red');\n# Raster + computed vector layer\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(nz.union_all(), crs=nz.crs) \\\n    .to_crs(nz_elev.crs) \\\n    .buffer(22200) \\\n    .exterior \\\n    .plot(ax=ax, color='red');\n# Raster + two vector layers\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, ax=ax)\ngpd.GeoSeries(nz.union_all(), crs=nz.crs) \\\n    .to_crs(nz_elev.crs) \\\n    .buffer(22200) \\\n    .exterior \\\n    .plot(ax=ax, color='red')\nnz_height.to_crs(nz_elev.crs).plot(ax=ax, color='yellow');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Raster + vector layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Raster + computed vector layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Raster + two vector layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.15: Combining a raster and vector layers in the same plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the drawing order of layers is not necessarily according to the order of expressions, in the code, but according to layer type. For example, by default line layers are drawn on top of point layers. To override the default plotting order, we can use the zorder argument of .plot. Layers with higher zorder values will be drawn on top. For example, the following would draw layer2 on top of layer1 (regaredless of their types).\nbase = layer1.plot(zorder=1)\nlayer2.plot(ax=base, zorder=2);\n\n\n\n\n8.2.6 Basemaps\nBasemaps, or background layers, are often useful to provide context to the displayed layers (which are in the “foreground”). Basemaps are ubiquitous in interactive maps (see Section 8.3). However, they are often useful in static maps too.\nBasemaps can be added to geopandas static plots using the contextily package. A preliminary step is to convert our layers to EPSG:3857 (“Web Mercator”), to be in agreement with the basemaps, which are typically provided in this CRS1. For example, let’s take the small \"Nelson\" polygon from nz, and reproject it to 3857.\n\nnzw = nz[nz['Name'] == 'Nelson'].to_crs(epsg=3857)\n\nTo add a basemap, we use the contextily.add_basemap function, similarly to the way we added multiple layers (Section 8.2.5). The default basemap is “OpenStreetMap”. You can specify a different basemap using the source parameter, with one of the values in cx.providers (Figure 8.16).\n# OpenStreetMap\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))\nax = nzw.plot(color='none', ax=ax)\ncx.add_basemap(ax, source=cx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik);\n# CartoDB.Positron\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))\nax = nzw.plot(color='none', ax=ax)\ncx.add_basemap(ax, source=cx.providers.CartoDB.Positron);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) ‘OpenStreetMap’ basemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) ‘CartoDB Positron’ basemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.16: Adding a basemap to a static map, using contextily\n\n\n\nCheck out the gallery for more possible basemaps. Custom basemaps (such as from your own raster tile server) can be also specified using a URL. Finally, you may read the Adding a background map to plots tutorial for more examples.\n\n\n8.2.7 Faceted maps\nFaceted maps are multiple maps displaying the same symbology for the same spatial layers, but with different data in each panel. The data displayed in the different panels typically refer to different properties, or time steps. For example, the nz layer has several different properties for each polygon, stored as separate attributes:\n\nvars = ['Land_area', 'Population', 'Median_income', 'Sex_ratio']\nnz[vars]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand_area\nPopulation\nMedian_income\nSex_ratio\n\n\n\n\n0\n12500.561149\n175500.0\n23400\n0.942453\n\n\n1\n4941.572557\n1657200.0\n29600\n0.944286\n\n\n2\n23900.036383\n460100.0\n27900\n0.952050\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n13\n9615.976035\n51100.0\n25700\n0.971898\n\n\n14\n422.195242\n51400.0\n27200\n0.925967\n\n\n15\n10457.745485\n46200.0\n27900\n0.957792\n\n\n\n\n16 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\nWe may want to plot them all in a faceted map, that is, four small maps of nz with the different variables. To do that, we initialize the plot with the expected number of panels, such as ncols=len(vars) if we wish to have one row and four columns, and then go over the variables in a for loop, each time plotting vars[i] into the ax[i] panel (Figure 8.17).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=len(vars), figsize=(9, 2))\nfor i in range(len(vars)):\n    nz.plot(ax=ax[i], column=vars[i], legend=True)\n    ax[i].set_title(vars[i])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.17: Faceted map, four different variables of nz\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case we prefer a specific layout, rather than one row or one column, we can initialize the required number or rows and columns, as in plt.subplots(nrows,ncols), “flatten” ax, so that the facets are still accessible using a single index ax[i] (rather than the default ax[i][j]), and plot into ax[i]. For example, here is how we can reproduce the last plot, this time in a \\(2 \\times 2\\) layout, instead of a \\(1 \\times 4\\) layout (Figure 8.18). One more modification we are doing here is hiding the axis ticks and labels, to make the map less “crowded”, using ax[i].xaxis.set_visible(False) (and same for .yaxis).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=int(len(vars)/2), figsize=(6, 6))\nax = ax.flatten()\nfor i in range(len(vars)):\n    nz.plot(ax=ax[i], column=vars[i], legend=True)\n    ax[i].set_title(vars[i])\n    ax[i].xaxis.set_visible(False)\n    ax[i].yaxis.set_visible(False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.18: 2D layout in a faceted map, using a for loop\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to “manually” specify the properties of each panel, and which row/column it goes in (e.g., Figure 2.2). This can be useful when the various panels have different components, or even completely different types of plots (e.g., Figure 5.4), making automation with a for loop less applicable. For example, here is a plot similar to Figure 8.18, but specifying each panel using a separate expression instead of using a for loop (Figure 8.19).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=int(len(vars)/2), figsize=(6, 6))\nnz.plot(ax=ax[0][0], column=vars[0], legend=True)\nax[0][0].set_title(vars[0])\nnz.plot(ax=ax[0][1], column=vars[1], legend=True)\nax[0][1].set_title(vars[1])\nnz.plot(ax=ax[1][0], column=vars[2], legend=True)\nax[1][0].set_title(vars[2])\nnz.plot(ax=ax[1][1], column=vars[3], legend=True)\nax[1][1].set_title(vars[3]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.19: 2D layout in a faceted map, using “manual” specification of the panels\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the first code chunk in the next section for another example of manual panel contents specification.\n\n\n8.2.8 Exporting\nStatic maps can be exported to a file using the matplotlib.pyplot.savefig function. For example, the following code section recreates fig-two-layers, but this time the last expression saves the image to a JPG image named plot_geopandas.jpg.\n\nbase = nz.plot(color='none')\nnz_height.plot(ax=base, color='red');\nplt.savefig('output/plot_geopandas.jpg')\n\nFigures with rasters can be exported exactly the same way. For example, the following code section (Section 8.2.5) creates an image of a raster and a vector layer, which is then exported to a file named plot_rasterio.jpg.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, ax=ax)\nnz.to_crs(nz_elev.crs).plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='r');\nplt.savefig('output/plot_rasterio.jpg')\n\nImage file properties can be controlled through the plt.subplots and plt.savefig parameters. For example, the following code section exports the same raster plot to a file named plot_rasterio2.svg, which has different dimensions (width = 5 \\(in\\), height = 7 \\(in\\)), a different format (SVG), and different resolution (300 \\(DPI\\)).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 7))\nrasterio.plot.show(nz_elev, ax=ax)\nnz.to_crs(nz_elev.crs).plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='r');\nplt.savefig('output/plot_rasterio2.svg', dpi=300)",

    "section": "8.3 Interactive maps",
    "text": "8.3 Interactive maps\nWhile static maps can enliven geographic datasets, interactive maps can take them to a new level. Interactivity can take many forms, the most common and useful of which is the ability to pan around and zoom into any part of a geographic dataset overlaid on a ‘web map’ to show context. Less advanced interactivity levels include popups which appear when you click on different features, a kind of interactive label. More advanced levels of interactivity include the ability to tilt and rotate maps, and the provision of “dynamically linked” sub-plots which automatically update when the user pans and zooms (Pezanowski et al. 2018).\nThe most important type of interactivity, however, is the display of geographic data on interactive or ‘slippy’ web maps. Significant features of web maps are that (1) they eventually comprise static HTML files, easily shared and accessed by a wide audience, and (2) they can “grab” content (e.g., basemaps) or use services from other locations on the internet, that way providing detailed context without much requiring much effort from the person who created the map. The most popular approaches for web mapping, in Python and elsewhere, are based on the Leaflet JavaScript library (Dorman 2020). The folium Python package provides an extensive interface to create customized web maps based on Leaflet; it is recommended for highly-custimized maps. However, the geopandas wrapper .explore, introduced in Section 1.2.2, can be used for a wide range of scenarios which are often sufficient. This is what we cover in this section.\n\n8.3.1 Minimal example\nAn interactive map of a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame can be created with .explore (Section 1.2.2).\n\nnz.explore()\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.20: Minimal example of an interactive vector layer plot with .explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Styling\nThe .explore method has a color parameter which affects both the fill and outline color. Other styling properties are specified using a dict through style_kwds (for general properties) and the marker_kwds (point-layer specific properties), as follows.\nThe style_kwds keys are mostly used to control the color and opacity of the outline and the fill:\n\nstroke—Whether to draw the outline\ncolor—Outline color\nweight—Outline width (in pixels)\nopacity—Outline opacity (from 0 to 1)\nfill—Whether to draw fill\nfillColor—Fill color\nfillOpacity—Fill opacity (from 0 to 1)\n\nFor example, here is how we can set green fill color and 30% opaque black outline of nz polygons in .explore (Figure 8.21):\n\nnz.explore(color='green', style_kwds={'color':'black', 'opacity':0.3})\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.21: Styling of polygons in .explore\n\n\n\n\nThe dict passed to marker_kwds controls the way that points are displayed:\n\nradius—Curcle radius (in \\(m\\) for circle, see below) or in pixels (for circle_marker)\nfill—Whether to draw fill (for circle or circle_marker)\n\nAdditionally, for points, we can set the marker_type, to one of:\n\n'marker'—A PNG image of a marker\n'circle'—A vector circle with radius specified in \\(m\\)\n'circle_marker'—A vector circle with radius specified in pixels (the default)\n\nFor example, the following expression draws 'circe_marker’ points with 20 pixel radius, green fill, and black outline (Figure 8.22).\n\nnz_height.explore(\n    color='green', \n    style_kwds={'color':'black', 'opacity':0.5, 'fillOpacity':0.1}, \n    marker_kwds={'radius':20}\n)\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.22: Styling of points in .explore (using circle_marker)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.23 demonstrates the 'marker_type' option. Note that the above-mentioned styling properties (other then opacity) are not applicable when using marker_type='marker', because the markers are fixed PNG images.\n\nnz_height.explore(marker_type='marker')\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.23: Styling of points in .explore (using marker)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Layers\nTo display multiple layers, one on top of another, with .explore, we use the m argument, which stands for the previous map (Figure 8.24).\n\nm = nz.explore()\nnz_height.explore(m=m, color='red')\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.24: Displaying multiple layers in an interactive map with .explore\n\n\n\n\nOne of the advantages of interactive maps is the ability to turn layers “on” and “off”. This capability is implemented in folium.LayerControl from package folium, which the geopandas .explore method is a wrapper of. For example, this is how we can add a layer control for the nz and nz_height layers (Figure 8.25). Note the name properties, used to specify layer names in the control, and the collapsed property, used to specify whether the control is fully visible at all times (False), or on mouse hover (True, the default).\n\nm = nz.explore(name='Polygons (adm. areas)')\nnz_height.explore(m=m, color='red', name='Points (elevation)')\nfolium.LayerControl(collapsed=False).add_to(m)\nm\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.25: Displaying multiple layers in an interactive map with .explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Symbology\nSymbology can be specified in .explore using similar arguments as in .plot (Section 8.2.3). For example, Figure 8.26 is an interactive version of Figure 8.6 (a).\n\nnz.explore(column='Median_income', legend=True, cmap='Reds')\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.26: Symbology in an interactive map of a vector layer, created with .explore\n\n\n\n\nFixed styling (Section 8.3.4) can be combined with symbology settings. For example, polygon outline colors in Figure 8.26 are styled according to 'Median_income', however, this layer has overlapping outlines and their color is arbitrarily set according to the order of features (top-most features), which may be misleading and confusing. To specify fixed outline colors (e.g., black), we can use the color and weight properties of style_kwds (Figure 8.27):\n\nnz.explore(column='Median_income', legend=True, cmap='Reds', style_kwds={'color':'black', 'weight': 0.5})\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.27: Symbology combined with fixed styling in .explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Basemaps\nThe basemap in .explore can be specified using the tiles argument. Several popular built-in basemaps can be specified using a string:\n\n'OpenStreetMap'\n'CartoDB positron'\n'CartoDB dark_matter'\n\nOther basemaps are available through the xyzservices package (see xyzservices.providers for a list), or using a custom tile server URL. For example, the following expression displays the 'CartoDB positron' tiles in an .explore map (Figure 8.28).\n\nnz.explore(tiles='CartoDB positron')\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nFigure 8.28: Specifying the basemap in .explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.6 Exporting\nAn interactive map can be exported to an HTML file using the .save method of the map object. The HTML file can then be shared with other people, or published on a server and shared through a URL2. A good free option for publishing a web map is through GitHub Pages.\nFor example, here is how we can export the map shown in Figure 8.25, to a file named map.html.\n\nm = nz.explore(name='Polygons (adm. areas)')\nnz_height.explore(m=m, color='red', name='Points (elevation)')\nfolium.LayerControl(collapsed=False).add_to(m)\nm.save('output/map.html')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrewer, Cynthia A. 2015.
